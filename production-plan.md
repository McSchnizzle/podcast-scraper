# Production Plan — Daily Podcast Digest (Revised for Hybrid Local+CI Model)
**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2025-09-06  
**Maintainers:** Project Lead (Paul) & Deployment Engineer (DX)  

> Scope: This revision **accepts** the hybrid operating model by design:
> - **Local machine** (this Mac) runs the **YouTube transcript ingest** via cron **every 6 hours** and pushes updated state to Git.
> - **GitHub Actions** runs the **daily digest** pipeline on schedule, consuming the state pushed by the local job.
> - **SQLite** remains the primary database. No Postgres migration required.
> - **Docker is optional**. Host-OS runtime is supported.
> - The RSS feed **stays at** `https://podcast.paulrbrown.org/daily-digest.xml`.
> 
> Items completed through Phase 4 remain excluded. This document focuses on hardening the chosen hybrid model with pragmatic safeguards, not re-architecting it.

## 0) Target Operating Model (Accepted “Production-Lite”)
- **Pipelines**
  - **Local YouTube ingest** (cron ~6h): collects metadata/transcripts into the **YouTube DB/process you already have**, then commits and pushes state to Git.
  - **CI Daily Digest** (GH Actions, once per day): reads repo inputs + local-pushed state, generates the digest, updates the RSS, and publishes.
- **State & Storage**
  - **SQLite** (single-user, single-writer): primary state with **WAL** enabled; DB files kept **outside the repo**.
  - Optional **exports** (JSON/CSV) committed to Git if/when needed by CI (append-safe, small footprint).
- **Secrets**
  - **Local**: `.env` file with restricted permissions; no shell `export` in profiles; optionally use Keychain/1Password.
  - **CI**: GitHub Actions **repository/environment secrets**; never logged.
- **Observability**
  - **Structured JSON logs** (local + CI), short retention (14 days).
  - **Healthchecks** for both local cron and CI digest jobs.
- **RSS & Hosting**
  - Keep `daily-digest.xml` at **podcast.paulrbrown.org**. If audio enclosures are present, host them under the same domain (or another you control) with correct `Content-Type` and range support.
- **Backups/DR**
  - Nightly **SQLite `.backup`** snapshots retained for **14 days**.
  - Optional mirrored copies of backups to **GitHub Artifacts** (14-day retention) or **Dropbox**.

## Phase 0 — Ratify Hybrid Model & Add Guardrails ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Goal:** Keep your local YouTube pipeline exactly as-is, but make it safer and more observable for CI consumption. No migration to GH runners. No DB re-platform.

### 0.1 Local YouTube Cron — Safety & Atomicity ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Work:**
- ✅ **Locking:** File-based locking implemented in `scripts/yt_push_atomic.sh` with stale lock detection
- ✅ **Atomic writes:** Atomic Git operations with proper staging and single commits
- ✅ **Git push guard:** 
  - ✅ `git status --porcelain` validation before commits
  - ✅ Single commit per cycle with structured messages (`YouTube sync: TIMESTAMP - N episodes processed`)
  - ✅ `pull.ff=only` configured with 3-attempt retry logic and rebase on conflicts
- ✅ **Failure handling:** Comprehensive error handling, rollback on failures, retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Logging:** Structured JSON logging to `~/Library/Logs/podcast-scraper/youtube-push.log` with rotation

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `scripts/yt_push_atomic.sh` - Complete atomic push implementation with locking
- ✅ `youtube_cron_job.sh` - Updated to use atomic push with structured logging
- ✅ Local logs at `~/Library/Logs/podcast-scraper/youtube_cron_*.log`

**Definition of Done (DoD):**
- ✅ Double-start is prevented via `.yt_push.lock` file
- ✅ Pushes are atomic with rollback on failure
- ✅ Logs show clear run status, counts, and timing

---

### 0.2 SQLite Reliability (Keep, Don't Migrate) ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Work:**
- ✅ Enable **WAL** + busy timeout:
  - ✅ `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;` - Already active, verified
  - ✅ `PRAGMA busy_timeout=30000;` - 30-second timeout implemented in `utils/db.py`
- ✅ Ensure **absolute path** to DB - Implemented in `DatabaseConnectionFactory`
- ✅ Add/verify **unique constraints** for idempotency - Database integrity enforced
- ✅ Nightly **`.backup`** to `~/.podcast-scraper-backups/` with **14-day retention** and compression
- ✅ Weekly **restore smoke test** implemented and verified

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `scripts/backup_sqlite.sh` - Complete backup system with integrity checks and restore testing
- ✅ `utils/db.py` - Enhanced with 30-second busy timeout and WAL verification
- ✅ `docs/operations-runbook.md` - Comprehensive operational procedures including backup/restore

**DoD:**
- ✅ WAL active and busy timeout set to 30 seconds
- ✅ Backup script tested and working with compression
- ✅ Restore test passing (verified 15 episodes restored successfully)

---

### 0.3 CI Daily Digest — Consumption Discipline ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Work:**
- ✅ **Convergence signal:** `state/yt_last_push.json` watermark file implemented with full metadata
- ✅ **Concurrency in CI:** Added `concurrency:` with `cancel-in-progress: false` to prevent overlapping runs
- ✅ **Timeouts & summaries:** 90-minute job timeout, comprehensive job summaries with episode counts and database status
- ✅ **Secrets:** Fast-fail environment validation step checks all required secrets before processing
- ✅ **Artifacts:** Failure artifacts upload (databases, logs, state files) with 14-day retention

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `.github/workflows/daily-podcast-pipeline.yml` - Updated with concurrency control, watermark reading, and enhanced monitoring
- ✅ `state/yt_last_push.json` - Watermark file with run metadata for CI traceability

**DoD:**
- ✅ CI runs daily with concurrency protection
- ✅ Watermark file read and displayed in job summary  
- ✅ Fast-fail on missing secrets implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive failure artifacts uploaded on errors

---

### 0.4 Healthchecks & Alerts (Local + CI) ✅ **COMPLETE** 
**Work:**
- ✅ **Local:** Ping `HEALTHCHECK_URL_YT` implemented in `scripts/yt_push_atomic.sh` and `youtube_cron_job.sh` with JSON payload
- ✅ **CI:** Ping `HEALTHCHECK_URL_RSS` implemented with episode counts, duration, and GitHub run ID
- ✅ **Failure handling:** Separate `/fail` endpoints for immediate failure alerts
- ✅ Alert configuration ready for YT ≤ 8h, RSS ≤ 26h cadence

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Environment variable integration in both local `.env` and GitHub Actions secrets
- ✅ `docs/operations-runbook.md` - Includes healthcheck setup and troubleshooting procedures

**DoD:**
- ✅ Healthcheck pings implemented with structured JSON payloads
- ✅ Success and failure paths handled appropriately
- ✅ Ready for external healthcheck service configuration

---

### 0.5 RSS + Hosting (Keep Your URL) ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Work:**
- ✅ RSS feed continues publishing to `https://podcast.paulrbrown.org/daily-digest.xml` (preserved)
- ✅ **Audio enclosures** handling verified in existing `rss_generator_multi_topic.py`
- ✅ **14-day pruning** concept documented for future implementation
- ✅ CI workflow includes RSS feed generation and Git commits

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `docs/operations-runbook.md` - Includes RSS feed operations and validation procedures
- ✅ Existing RSS generation pipeline preserved and enhanced with better error handling

**DoD:**
- ✅ Feed URL maintained at podcast.paulrbrown.org
- ✅ Audio enclosure support verified in existing codebase  
- ✅ RSS generation integrated into CI workflow

---

### 0.6 Minimal Security Hygiene ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Work:**
- ✅ Local `.env` with **0600** permissions set and verified
- ✅ No shell profile `export`s - secure environment variable loading in scripts
- ✅ Secrets never logged - error handling redacts sensitive information
- ✅ GitHub Actions secrets validation and secure environment handling

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `docs/phase0-improvements.md` - Complete documentation of security improvements and environment variables
- ✅ Enhanced scripts with secure `.env` loading and secret redaction
- ✅ `.env` file permissions secured to owner-only (600)

**DoD:**
- ✅ No secrets in repo or logs
- ✅ .env file properly secured with 600 permissions
- ✅ Environment separation clear between local and CI

---

## Phase 5 — Observability & Idempotency (Soon After 0)
*(Renumbered to align with earlier documents while skipping finished work)*

### 5.1 Structured Logging Everywhere
- Unified JSON logging format keys: `ts, level, module, run_id, source, episode_id, event, duration_ms, err`.
- CI preserves failure logs as artifacts.

**DoD:** Diagnose from one page: what ran, what changed, what failed.

### 5.2 Idempotency & Retry Safety
- Enforce UPSERTs on unique keys; deterministic filenames; content-hash checks before re-processing.
- Exponential backoff with jitter for network operations.

**DoD:** Re-runs produce no dupes and no corruptions.

### 5.3 Backups & Restore Drill
- Keep nightly SQLite backups 14 days; monthly one-command **restore drill** documented.

**DoD:** Verified restore ≤ 30 minutes.

---

## Optional Tracks (Only if/when you want)
- **Dockerize** to standardize ffmpeg/Python. Not required today.
- **Postgres** if scale/concurrency ever grows (out of scope now).

## Acceptance Criteria (Go/No-Go for "Production-Lite")
- 🔄 Local YT cron runs cleanly for **7 consecutive days**, pushes atomic state, and pings healthcheck. **(Implementation complete, 7-day validation pending)**
- 🔄 Daily digest CI runs successfully for the same window; shows the **last YT commit watermark**. **(Implementation complete, 7-day validation pending)**
- ✅ No DB files in Git; WAL on; nightly backups retained 14 days; restore drill documented. **(COMPLETE - backups tested and working)**
- ✅ Secrets handled via `.env` (local) and GH secrets (CI); never logged in plaintext. **(COMPLETE - .env secured, no logging of secrets)**
- 🔄 Re-runs do not produce duplicates; logs are structured and searchable. **(Implementation complete, validation pending)**

**Phase 0 Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Ready for 7-day validation period

---

## Risk Register (Acknowledged by Design)
- **Local single point of failure** (laptop off/asleep): mitigated by healthchecks and retries; accepted for single-user scope.
- **Git-based state handoff**: mitigated via atomic writes, push guard, and watermark file.
- **SQLite locking**: mitigated via WAL, single writer, and busy_timeout.

## Appendix A — Sample Atomic Push Script (Local)
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

REPO_DIR="$HOME/path/to/repo"
LOCK_FILE="$REPO_DIR/.yt.lock"
STATE_DIR="$REPO_DIR/state"
WATERMARK="$STATE_DIR/yt_last_push.json"

cd "$REPO_DIR"

# Simple lock
exec 9>"$LOCK_FILE"
if ! flock -n 9; then
  echo "Another run is in progress; exiting."
  exit 0
fi

# Ensure only intended changes staged
git pull --ff-only
# Write/rename any export files here if you use them
# mv data.tmp.jsonl data.jsonl

CHANGES=$(git status --porcelain)
if [ -z "$CHANGES" ]; then
  echo "No changes to push."
  exit 0
fi

RUN_ID=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
git add -A
git commit -m "yt: update state (run_id=$RUN_ID)"
git push

mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ > /tmp/pushed_at
jq -n --arg run_id "$RUN_ID" --arg sha "$COMMIT_SHA" --arg pushed_at "$(cat /tmp/pushed_at)" \
  '{run_id:$run_id, commit_sha:$sha, pushed_at:$pushed_at}' > "$WATERMARK"
git add "$WATERMARK" && git commit -m "yt: watermark $RUN_ID" && git push || true
```
