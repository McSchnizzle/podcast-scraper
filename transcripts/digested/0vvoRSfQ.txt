[00:00] So, I put together a music video, a mini
[00:02] music video for a different Nirvana
[00:05] track. So, I was trying to capture like
[00:06] a 1990s high school band auditorium
[00:10] little dystopian energy. So, I generated
[00:12] all these clips in a pretty
[00:14] straightforward way. I used GPT40 to
[00:16] help me with the prompts. Said, "Hey,
[00:18] help me capture grunge 1990s Seattle
[00:20] inspired by some of these music videos."
[00:22] And then, as you can see, it gets
[00:23] progressively more like camcorder grimy.
[00:26] So, I generated all this stuff and then
[00:28] I threw it together into a music video.
[00:31] All right, let's watch.
[00:33] [Music]
[00:41] Look at the patented Clairvo raised
[00:43] hands reaction on this one. I cannot
[00:46] believe this is AI generated. It's so
[00:48] high quality. It's so specific in
[00:51] aesthetic, in a wardrobe, an emotion.
[00:54] You have inspired me after this podcast.
[00:56] What music video am I going to make?
[00:58] It's so much fun.
