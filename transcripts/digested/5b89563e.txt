We are back. Welcome to the champagne room. Being joined by our guest from the first hour, Jessica San Luis, who again has Wi-Fi problems. She might be a little pixely here and there. She might be coming in and out, but she can hear us. You can hear us, right, Jessica? I can hear you mostly. I'm so sorry. Yeah, we're having terrible Wi-Fi issues here. And because we're in the champagne room, I feel more comfortable because I'm here with friends. I'm here with my comrades. We put the comments on the screen so you can actually see what people are saying on the screen. Oh, no, you froze. I didn't freeze. Uh-oh. Am I still here? You're still here. Yes. People are talking shit about my shirt because it is warm here in my room in Mexico because we're having a bit of a heat wave. Jessica hasn't been around for the champagne room. She's having a heat wave up north in the Bay Area. All of California is dealing with a heat wave. Down here, it's just really nice. It's just really fucking nice. It's like 78. There's a nice breeze. If I walked outside right now, where I should be doing the champagne room, it would be just gorgeous. Just gorgeous. There's just, you know, angels on the one eye. Yeah, it's still 87 degrees here. Oh, yeah, fuck that noise. Um, Jessica has missed the most important video clip in the last year. Tir. I have failed you guys. I have failed you guys because I haven't cut this and put it on the soundboard. But I need her to see. You can't just hear it. You do have to see it to really understand the logic behind this clip. I thought I lost it. A very, very good patron of the show found it and sent it to me so we can watch this. For those of you new to the champagne room, welcome. So glad to have you here. You are about to witness my favorite clip in the last easily the last year. I don't know if anything's going to top this. You got it, snack wait. Well, Butrin. Well, Butrin. Jessica, buckle up. Fuck you. Well, Butrin. Don't do it. Don't do it. Fill me all you want, little dick coward fucking faggot. I'll knock your ass out, boy. Well, then you would be filming your own prime. Hey, was he lying, though? If you knock him out, you're going to film your own crime. Don't hit him. I don't know why he's so mad, but leave people alone. First and foremost, just leave people alone. You didn't have to record the guy. You could have told your friends about it. It would have been equally as funny if you're a good storyteller. But one more, Jessica, are you still there? Oh, no. Oh, we lost her. That's fine. You know why it's fine? Because we're going to watch this again. All right. Fuck you. Well, you tricked me. Don't do it. You're a fucking baggage. Don't do it. Film me all you want, little dick coward fucking baggage. I'll knock your ass up. Well, then you would be filming your own crime. Coach looks just turns on video. Poor Jessica got zapped by the internet. But I'm sure you guys are going, hey, Jason, yes, I have videos ready for you to go. I do have some JPEG videos here as well. Because, of course, I'm going to have fucking JPEG videos. Pro wrestling is something I follow. I don't know if you guys have ever gone to like an underground wrestling event. Underground wrestling to me is way crazier than anything you're going to see on like ECW or whatever it's called now. I forget what it's called now. WWE. There's nothing you're going to see on a televised match that matches the insanity of an underground, like in a fucking hotel ballroom ass wrestling match. Let's see. Bam. Now you're there. Okay. Maybe. We'll see. Ask me all of your important questions really, really quickly before my Wi-Fi goes out. The important questions are: did you see the Welbutron guy? Oh, I guess her Wi-Fi went out again. Did you see the Welbutren? Okay, well, this is a wrestling event. I don't know where it is, but it doesn't matter because it's fucking awesome. Did you were you able to see that, Jessica? The dude apparently is very upset about this, but like I said, underground wrestling is so much crazier than anything you're going to see. It is. What was that guy? Kimbo Slice. I guess that's not wrestling. That's like backyard Tom. That's backyard fighting. And if someone put a drill dildo in Kimbo's mouth, oof. Isn't he dead? I thought he died. Yeah, he's passed away. Yeah, yeah. He's no longer with us. He's no longer with us. Don't do that. Don't put a drill dough in Kimbo's mouth. A drill dough. Something off of Jackass Six. Are they already at six? I'm also, I don't know. I'm also a real big into redneck fights. Oh, those are fun. It's like what are those like fancy chickens called? You know how they have like the Cornish gameheads? Yes. It's like watching them fight. It's like Cornish gameheads. Fancy chickens. There's redneck fights are awesome. I never get to see the fight, but they always post these shit talk battles back and forth with each other. A lot of this is happening in West Virginia and the Carolinas. Is a husband-wife, yes, yes. This is the husband, wife, and the baby daddy fuel feet. Fuse, okay. Let's hear they call it Hillbilly Showdown. Now we're not going to be able to do it. Soft, white, underbelly. I'm Angel. I'm the wife of Justin, the wife, because we're still married. He divorced me. Also, the baby mama to the drama. She ain't nobody, he ain't nobody. We don't divorce faces. I'm silent. We ain't never been at all together. Yeah, they're not. Yeah, yeah, we live together. We live together, but not like together. Let's definitely separate that together part there. I'm the father of the two youngest. He's kept away from me for years. That's why I want to beat his ass again. Wait, is this like this is real? This is not Jerry Swift. It's the same guy. No, it's just. She has similar tastes, but they are different. Man, it's not the before and after. It is not a before and after. How many are they brothers? That's what I'm wondering. Cousins, kissing cousins. I don't think they're related. I've never seen soft white underbellies. Why is it every time you're out of the business? She's allowed to come and bring my kids back around me. What's up, huh? Huh? But when you're in the business, they ain't allowed to talk to you. What's up? Swing! Do ball! Swing! Do it! Shut up! I just want to say, if you're going to have a hillbilly brawl, don't do it on the concrete. No, that's that's the same parking lot with the lady who had a meltdown about her McRib. Her McRib? I'm sorry. You've not seen the McRib lady. Um, the McRib lady? Are you making the McCrib lady's anti-I'm not making? Please, everybody in the chat, tell me that I'm not making up. The McRib lady is phenomenal, and I'm pretty sure that it was filmed in that parking lot. Uh, someone someone said in the comments she loves this. Who's watching the kids right now, by the way? They are the kids. August 16th, baby! Wow! But here we are. I guess we'll settle it in the green. So if they have to be outside the ring, we'll get it done legally. Come on! So I want the cage mash. I want hillbillies and thunderdome. Where's that? I think that's what they're trying to promote. Mercusho says this is against my civil rights. It's, I don't want to laugh too. First of all, nobody wanted to fight, right? Most people don't want to fight. A lot of people love talking shit. I have talked my fair share of shit. Most people don't want to leave the house and get into a fight. These people seem to have valid reasons for getting into a fight. But is this the new Jerry Springer, Jessica? Yes, 100%. Me and my 21-year-old, we love to just sit around and watch these YouTube videos. Mostly, it's a sometimes it's very specific. Sometimes it's entitled Karens who are being arrested for DUIs. Those are great, by the way. Okay, but yes, 100%. That's why we're going to be able to do that. Have you seen the white woman? There's a new video off, maybe I have it of a white woman, and she gets arrested for, she's obviously drunk off her ass. And she's young. She's young, but she's with her landlord apparently in the car. So she, I think she was sadly going to work off the rent. And it's a crazy video all the way around. So the cop pulls her out of the car. She goes, and she gets on the phone and calls him when she goes, yeah, this fucking useless cop is here trying to arrest me. He wants me to get out of the car. And the cop goes, ma'am, I can smell the alcohol on your breath. He goes, you're going to have to get out of the car. She goes, I'm not getting out of the car. Do you know that there's a genocide in Gaza? And the cop goes, ma'am, you have to get out of the car. She goes, I'm not getting out of the car because there's a genocide. And I'm like, what the fuck is this woman saying? I've never seen a crash out like that before. Oh, there's so much fun. I honestly, I recommend it. Like, I used to, it was like a guilty pleasure. And now I'm like, fucking just blasted all over the internet. This shit is funny. I love the people who think they know the law, but like, just. Just be stupid. So, my favorite line: you didn't read me my Miranda rights. Ooh, you're not being interrogated. And this is what we say to those people: you having an unnatural allegiance to losers does not like you. This man right here has something that people don't talk about enough, which is meth strength. It's a thing, it's a real thing. Meth strength, you know, be ready for a meth strength man or woman. But it's not like, sorry, it's not like alcohol, like bravado where you're just gonna like run right at someone, like meth strengths, because like all this shit is firing in their heads, they're like zigzagging. You know what they're gonna be, and you're just like looking out for everybody. They're fun. Kush looks as sublation media didn't read me my Miranda rights before my well. Okay, this watch this. This was like, okay, and watch the guy at the store. So, obviously, this dude stole something and they automatically lock the doors on him. I love it. Oh, bless him. He's like, I'm on camera. I'm gonna get trespassed. I'm probably gonna get arrested. They're gonna come to my house with a warrant, but I your window up. Dude, he knocked the entire door through. And the guy, the server was, hey, impressive. I'm gonna stand over here. You're obviously free to go, sir. But as he's on his way out, he drops his pipe and he goes, Uh-uh, we can't leave without the people. You cannot leave without the people. Someone said, Oh, wow! Oh, wow, that is impressive. That's pretty impressive. I mean, it's the place. What was the thing for like our generation? Wasn't it like PCP made you like strong as 10 men? Yeah, but that's anymore. Uh, I don't know. You do work with the incarcerated. Anybody? No, you know what it is. You know what everybody's doing? I want you to guess: what is the most prevalent abused drug in prisons in prison in prison with their sneaking in, or they make mostly the COs bring it in, but yes, fan. No, what did someone say? No, uh, the shit that they're supposed to give you to get off a heroin, really? Yeah, people get in there, but people also most of the time, it's COs that mule it in. Um, occasionally, visitors will get popped, but it's almost always Suboxone. They soak it in our matchbooks. That doesn't clip the matchbook off. I thought that was supposed to get you off a heroin, though. Well, but I mean, if you're not actually a heroin addict and you're sitting in prison with nothing else to do, like doing a little Suboxone sounds great. Weird. Yeah. I mean, because a lot of it comes from inside. It's not street. Oh, someone says so you're not sick in jail. Oh, that makes sense then. Okay, that definitely makes sense. It seems like they adopt it. No, I mean, once you hear it, it makes total sense. But it's a big problem because the people that aren't actually prescribed Suboxone tend to overdose on it. There's a heavyset white woman that apparently is a newscaster somewhere in America, and she read all of her hate comments on air. And some of them were so funny that she couldn't help but to laugh. Yeah. Here you go. That's like the NBA players that were reading all the hate tweets on like Jimmy Kimmel or something. This wasn't fun. Like some of these were mean. And she was trying to read them. The whole point was to be like, hey, I see what you guys are saying. Please stop being mean. You know, body positivity, but bullshit. But this is what happened. Honest opinion: touch up the bangs, lose 15 to 20 pounds. Go get them. Now that fills a frame. As you guys can see from this graphic here, pig emoji built for breeding tonight at five. Tonight at five. Well, isn't she? I mean, she can have seven kids real easy, I feel. At the same fucking time. Yeah, totally. Kind of built for breeding. If someone told me she wasn't with a black man, I'd be surprised. She has a nose ring. Ooh. So there's a thing now about nose rings. And now people are telling women, what are they calling it? They're calling it. Oh, if you guys know in the chat, tell me. They're calling it something. So women will walk up with the, with the sep. Now it's the septum ring. Yeah. And they're like, if you have a septum ring, you're a certain. Oh, I think I found a video about it. Let me see if I can find it. Here, be charming while I'm doing the septum ring. I just have the nose ring. That's what the nose ring's for. Charming. Wait, the nose ring is like a identifier to tell black man in the wild that yeah, because I can't dance. So I gotta do something. So you're like, I have this nose ring. I don't even have to do it. It's a beacon for according to you. I never even thought that until I knew you. I'm sure you've shared your theory about Jewish girls with nose rings, right? Oof. No, we haven't. Oh, we don't say that's one of the off-air things that you were privy to. Whoops. Should have come with some kind of a warning label then. Someone said Jessica is a hot Cheeto forensics investigator. That's what I wanted to be instead of going into law. Wait, who said that? I'm not wearing my glasses. Uh-oh, Drea says, Your daughter is Drea. You are a white woman, or you know, you're part native. But if your daughter has a nose ring, do you have a black son-in-law? Black son-in-law, Drea. Is that why you feel comfortable watching the show? Is that really what's going on? Tony says you fit perfectly in the champagne room. I'm trying to find this thing about, I found a video where this chick was talking about nose rings. And I swear, I was trying to get out of sharing your theory because apparently it wasn't supposed to spill beans about that one. You're not supposed to talk about nose rings. That was fight club. And you weren't supposed to talk about fight club. There's a nose ring club. There is a nose ring club. Really? Because I want to join. I don't think you want to join. Learn some better signals. That is not the club you want to be in. I thought that's the club I joined when I went on school. What is it? Not School of Fish. Plenty of Fish. It's probably what School of Fish. I was on the wrong fucking website. Tony says, I think this has something to do with Jutes. Pascal Robert. Oh, you're blaming on him. I will blame it on him. He made one of the funniest statements ever about nose rings. And I will not repeat it. Like, Hesika is. I didn't repeat it. But hot Cheeto forensics is your new nickname. So you have a nickname in prison streets. So we have a whole theory about hot Cheetos. There's hot Cheeto behavior, which is basically just bullshit. It does revolve around Mexican women, but anyone can have hot Cheeto behavior. If you eat hot Cheetos, there's a certain way you're going to act. There's some things you're going to deal with. If your girl eats hot Cheetos, you're going to get your car keyed. You're going to get into some fights because she's in the mood. And they're not just like fights, like normal people fights. They are real deal. I'm going to call you a pussy for an hour and a half until it gets physical. And I'm probably going to break your PlayStation. I don't eat hot Cheetos, but those women sound like the people I want to be hanging out with. It's fucking fun as shit. Yeah, until it's not. When does it not become fun to call someone a pussy for an hour? I don't want to be at that point in life. Drea says my son's girlfriend loves hot Cheetos. Well, Drea, Drea, here hide his Xbox. Yeah, get your son. I know this seems like fun because she's fiery and you think that's passion. Oh no, young man, that's crazy. Get out now while you still have a chance, while there's still a glimmer of hope in your mind. That hot Cheeto behavior will kill you. You will have hypertension by 28. Get out now. I have a question. Yes. What do hot Cheetos become when they get older and mature or get older and unattractive? Those puffy, hot, fucking generic puffs. My kids leave in the cabin until the ants get to them. Fabulous. See, Drea says she's messing now. I want to men can have hot Cheeto behavior too. There are shitty dudes out there that exhibit hot Cheeto B havior. Okay. We watched a hot Cheeto man a few weeks ago in the champagne room. The dude that just got out of prison, Jessica, I got to find this video. This dude gets out of prison and it's, I, if I think it might be a bit, I really hope it's a bit. I don't want to believe it's real. The chick's like, I'm waiting for my man. And she's like showing what she brought, the presents that she brought for him. And it was white Air Force ones, a white tee, and a Dodger's hat. I was like, why would you give that man the uniform he was wearing when he got arrested? When he got arrested, that is hot Cheeto behavior. You can go into the uni. You can go into the Halloween spirit store, and that's under the sign that says sexy gangster. Yeah. Be a trollo for Halloween. And that dude did hot Cheeto shit, right? He had, he put the outfit on. She she puts it, she pans the camera because she's so happy he's out. And what does he do? He throws up the middle finger because he's on his way back. Hot Cheetos. Hot fucking Cheetos. Yep. No, that's 100% true. I will say Cheetos are a commodity in prison. Chips in general are a commodity because they're one of the only brand name food items that you can get in commissary. So people actually like, well, some people sell store from their bunks, but people actually barter. For some reason, the red Doritos are worth way more than the blue Doritos. Blue Doritos are trash. They're terrible. I mean, it does make sense, but I'm not a fan. But okay, Zahir is 100% right. Hot Cheeto man behavior, they punch doors. There's going to be some holes in your drywall. If you have had holes in your drywall, if a dude has yelled at you about an outfit, the argument starts with an outfit. And the outfit is your like baggy don't touch me sweatpants and a shirt that has kid vomit on it and you guys are getting in an argument about you going to the store looking like that and it gets to the point where he punches a wall next to you but not you it's hot cheeto behavior get out of that situation get out while you still can't go find your dorito find your doritos. The Dorito man may have hotter breath, but you will have, you want the patched sheetrock. Even like a twice-baked cheez-It. Like that just sounds far more like foundational and supportive. You know what I've done, Hesica? I have stopped buying chips for my house. Since when? Right? Yeah. Yeah. Are you still making those 8,000 calorie breakfasts with homemade caramel sauce? Yeah. And I say that again. It sounds like I'm judging you, but that shit was fucking bomb. Well, okay, you've been in my house. Have I ever made? Because you know I don't do this. I only do this for myself. And I probably didn't even do it when you were here because I only do it for myself. I like this thing that people shit on me for called carrot raisin salad, but I'd never make it for guests. I've made it for you multiple times. I made you a carrot raisin salad. Yeah, with the raisins. Oh, no. And then I ate, you know, I ate so much of it one time that I was sick and ate all of the carrot raisin carrot salad. You didn't even like warn me. There's no warnings in anything that you do. Don't talk about the nose cream thing. Don't eat all the carrot salad. Like, you gotta tell the neophytes in the room what we're supposed to be doing. Jason needed to increase his raisin budget. So the chips. Had to suffer, no, but the carrot raisin salad is so worth like, definitely get rid of the chips for that. It's damn, she's had the carrot raisin salad. Did he froth your milk too, Jessica? Actually, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really five-star service. I can't like everybody should go have breakfast at Jason's house. 8,000 calories, and then he'll make you go for a run. Yeah, yeah, uh, can you read the comment on the screen? Can you see it? Oh, extremely fascist, but his shoes have to be right by the front door because he is equally terrified of scorpions. There's another comment. Can you see it? I feel set up. Let's go back to talking about no, I didn't. I didn't. I look, I've been telling everybody that I never give people carrot raisin salad, but you've actually been to the house probably more than anybody. I think the only person that's been in the house more. Make you sausage. No, I am actually a vegetarian. He's vegetarian. Yes, snack wait. Wearing shoes in the house is fucking weird. It's disgusting. Jesus. I totally agree with that. I'm so glad that my daughter can't hear me because she's always yelling me because sometimes I get lazy and I come in the back door and I keep my fucking shoes on. She's like, that doesn't count having adult children live with you is great. It's like having like an edgier, more cool version of your mother following you around. Oof. Damn. Damn. It's ruining all your fun. But they're preventing you from hot Cheeto men. How much fun can you have my school of fish? Let's be honest. School of fish. Well, I'm telling you, guys, my age, the only thing they're looking for is a mother or a wife or a weird, awkward combination of a weather or a mife. They want a mife. They want a mife. I, you know what? You know, you know, it's funny that you say that. It's funny that you say that because I agree with you. I think when you get to our age and you're single, you've probably dealt with children for a big portion of your life. Yeah, that's right. Something happened, right? Either you're a widow, widower, or there's been infidelity. You're probably walking in the door with some quote-unquote trauma. And now, because trauma language is just so common now, like everybody's a fucking narcissist. It is really hard to meet people because people have these fucking like, this is what I want, this is what I want, and I'm not going to settle for less because I settled for less in my marriage and I'm not going to do it this time. And I want a woman that does this and I want a woman that does that. So we're all lying in the initial, in the initial date because it's a job interview. And or we're holding something, which is fine, right? I don't fucking know you well enough to be super comfortable in front of you like that. But do you feel that because, again, you're not going to be uber comfortable in front of a stranger as you shouldn't be? No. At their first impression, because they can project everything onto you. And if you're mildly nice, mildly nice, like, hey, thank you. This was a great time. And you don't fuck them. They're like, that's my wife because she didn't fuck me on the first date. She's got her own job. I'm already sleeping on the couch. Fuck it. Yeah. Does that happen to you? Did it happen? Does it happen to you? So I actually have stopped. I have actually stopped caring about dating. Like, I, this sounds so like Hallmarky, but I really, I have so much on my plate right now, and I'm actually quite fulfilled with what I'm doing. And I'm finally at a point where I only have one child, you know, under the age of 18 at home. And it's, it's kind of liberating. But I will say that, yes, I mean, part of the problem with dating at our age, thank you so much, is you know how like that part where you're getting to know people and you're like learning their backstory? The backstory is fucking long. I know nobody wants to sit around and listen to the last 49 years of my life, and I certainly don't want to listen to the last 49 years of theirs. So it's like, where do you connect? I mean, do you just not talk about all that stuff and you get married after 18 months? And then like six months later, you're like, who the fuck is this person? Like, how do you navigate that? No, I had the weirdest. Dating experience, though, I had never actually gone. This is the mother-wife thing. I had, can I talk? Can I talk about this here? It's great. So, first of all, I really, if you are, I'm so sorry because this is probably missing a little bit. This guy had a huge tattoo of the Chicago Bulls mascot just all across his chest, which I didn't know because I wasn't in the dating pictures, but like that definitely would have been reflected. Had never gone out on a date, Jason, not one time. Had texted a couple times, phone calls, and then we were supposed to plan for a date that weekend. I was like, maybe I'll cancel, maybe I won't. And then this guy calls me and he's like, I'm headed to the airport. My brother's in the hospital, and I need your support now more than ever. And I'm like, What's your last name? Who the fuck? What? But of course, I was like, I felt bad because I was like, Oh my god, like maybe this guy's really having some kind of a breakdown. Because then he like flies out to where his brother is, and he's in the hospital by his brother's bedside, calls me and is like, Here, talk to my mom. She's so happy to meet you. I'm like, Whoa, whoa, how fucking awkward. Oh, sorry, your son's dying, man, but it's really great to virtually meet you. And I've never actually got on a date with your son, and I'm kind of having trouble remembering his name. So someone had me saved in their phone once as Mexico guy. That was me. I had you saved in your phone. It was the worst. Like, that was the moment I was like, I think I'm going to take these apps off my phone. Um, this person, I we would talk on the phone here and there, and I went to see her. She told me, she was like, oh, what are you doing? She had called me late. You know, women do that too. I call you at 11:30 midnight. That's because we've actually just gotten back from our actual date. Oh, damn. She just got back from an actual date. Now she wants to bang. And she was like, hey, what are you doing? And I was like, oh, I'm actually, I was about to leave to go up north. And she goes, oh, you should, you should stop by here. I'm like, no. She goes, no, you should stop by here. And I was like, okay. This sounds like a sure thing. And so it was, but she had told me she had stopped drinking. And I walked in her house and she hands me a drink. And I was like, I don't drink. She goes, oh, fuck. I forgot. I was like, I thought you said you stopped. Yeah. She was like, which one are you seven, right? Which one are you? She goes, oh, fuck, I forgot. And I said, I thought you said you stopped drinking. She goes, I fell off the wagon. And so we, these things happen. And then I fell off a wagon. And now I want to pity fuck. Yeah. And now you have to fuck the shame away. So I got back home and I tried to contact her and I didn't hear anything. And then I tried to contact her a couple more times. I didn't hear anything. And I figured, you know, another person goes to me like, I'm handing out some real mediocre dick. That's just how I felt. I felt like this dick is so mediocre, like, just change your number. But she did get back to me and she goes, oh, hey, I'm in rehab. I was the last person. I mean, that will allay your fears. That poof. I was like, okay, well, I still don't. I'm glad you're getting help, but I don't feel pretty. That's not our job anymore. Let's make it. Ready for a podcast that moves you to action?

You have names saved in your phone? No, I was going to actually tell kind of an off-color, not that funny joke about names in the phone. So this is. Oh, Jesus. Okay. But we can come back to that. Like I said, I believe in my soul that JPE is a piece of service. Hey, my name is James. I'm at Pocatello Women's Correct. I'm here doing a spin of time. I got a robbery beef and a possession charge. I always keep it 100, though. I'm a Okay, the two things that I love that people in justice-impacted ecosystems or the criminal justice system always say: so, what had happened was I keep it 100. And you know that everything after those two statements is utter bullshit. Bullshit. Shout out to Jessica for calling it out. Shout out. That is the most hot Cheeto shit. If you want, hey, I keep it 100. Oh, can I get a seat first for all these lies? Let me sit down first because you're going to bombard me. And I didn't work out today. So hold on. Let me sit down. I need a shovel. I need to, you know, my legs aren't as strong as they used to be from your fuckery. So let's see. Yeah, go ahead. Oh, go ahead. So one thing about so JPEG got bought up by Securus and these video chats don't exist anymore. Oh. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to get my life together and I'm just looking for somebody to vibe with. I'm fun. I'm flirtatious and I'm fine. If you want to hit me up, get on JPEG, send me a message, write me a letter, something. Hi, man. This is the triple F's. I forgot two of them, though. Fine. What? Fuck. I'm fine. I'm flirtatious. You know what that means? I have really good phone sex. That's what that means. That means you are about to flap serious ham to my phone sex game because I've had nothing to do here but perfect it. And if you just put some money on these books, I will make sure that you get tendinitis. I will make sure. Here's the thing: it's always phone sex. So at some point, like you've got to wonder if they're even actually into it, right? Like, oh, especially for the women, not for the guys. Someone says in the comments, I don't need to fix it. She is already perfect how she is. I can save her. Let's do some felonies, says another person. Oh my God. Fine, flirtatious, and felonious. Dude, all day. All day with JPEG. No, it's it's I've seen some of them. They're pretty funny. I mean, watch way too many of them. I mean, same with my body cam videos. Oh, dude, those. Okay. What say you about contemporary hip-hop? This is why I can't listen to new music. Here we have an area rug singing this BS. Listen to this. This guy, you're trying to get me into your day. I thought I done felt the same. I come on. Look, I can. This reminds me of a guy that I went to interview who had just been in mental health for quite some time. And he walked into the interview room entirely swathed in toilet paper, like this guy, head to toe, little cutouts for the mouth. And I was like, Um, what's going on with you today? And he was like, This keeps people from listening to my thoughts. And I was like, But it's toilet paper, and he's like, We don't get any tinfoil in here. And I was like, Okay, but how are you feeling today? And he goes, You know, I'm just feeling like I'm like one sandwich short of a picnic for someone wrapped in toilet paper. I feel like that was a really, really spot-on description. Yeah, at that point, you're like, You just have to laugh and go, Yeah, well, at least you know why you're here. Yeah, but that's what I thought. You know, it's so funny that you say that. That's what I thought when I saw that dude. I was like, You remind me of a dude that wasn't the home of the shelter. No, it's like that guy in what was that movie with Val Kilmer? Real Jesus? Yes, remember the end where they implant the thing and Kenneth's tooth and God's and he thinks God is talking to him. Nobody under the age of 45 is going to understand that reference at fucking all. No. And if you haven't seen Real Jeff, we put that on the list. We watched the movie Better Off Dead last night. You've seen Better Off. Yeah, thanks a lot. Two dollars. Yeah, we watched Better After last night. Yeah, it's a great movie. It's a great fucking movie. I watched this. I don't know what to call it. It's an altercation. It looks like it's in like Fresno or Fairfield, but some California city that starts with an F. And this dude says something in it that I thought was the funniest shit. Because you know how people talk shit. Like I said, no one wants to fight. Everybody wants to talk shit. And a guy, and this one guy is yelling and he's like, hey, man, my kids are here. And the dude goes, I don't give a fuck about your kids. Fuck your kids. And dude goes, hey, man, you better watch what you're saying. I'm not the one. He goes, well, I am the one. So you gotta see this. Because when he said it, I was like, hell yeah. I appreciated his candor. But I don't know why the fight. I don't know why the fight started. You don't know why. And then at a certain point, the girlfriend of the person holding the camera goes, You're just a narcissist. And I was like, Oh, man, you might need to get him just saying that. Like, that is not hood accepting. I know, for real. Hey, I keep real dice. I keep real nice. I keep real nice. Listen, stop, real nice. I'm not talking to someone with my lady with me. Oh, all right. Check yourself, dog. Oh, I don't know. What the fuck? I don't give a fuck. I don't care if your kids are here, motherfucker. I'll do that shit on glass. Your problem is bringing your kids here and trying to act this way. If you want to do that, then motherfucker can we do that shit. Shut the fuck up. Bring your motherfucking kids around. Don't bring your kids around this motherfucking environment. That's okay. I'm going viral. That's okay. Go fucking viral. Thank you. Somebody said, Don't ever fuck with a grown man that bought an entire 7-Eleven pizza first. But hold on, hold on, joke. You brought your motherfucking kids. It's a park, nigga. You're supposed to bring your kids. It's the park. Podbean, your message amplified. Ready to share your message with the world? Start your podcast journey with Podbean.

You demanded. No, you didn't. I didn't even ask anything. I just said exactly. You just said you asked. You're contradicting your time. You're part of your own life. You're funny as fuck. I said you're part of your life. Okay. Drop it, bro. Leave it on. Let his ass yapp. He's over arguing with a fucking female. Come on, let her go. I was arguing with you, motherfucker. Dang it, bro. Like I said, don't I now the reason why this clip is viral for those that don't know dude is calling this guy out in front of his chick and dude does nothing I'm the one, motherfucker. I'm the one. That's okay, everything. Don't fucking bring this to the rule. I don't even fucking know what you're trying to tell me what the fuck to do. Like I said, all you're letting me do. Yeah. Bring your fucking kids. I don't care. I live here for fucking five years. I live right in motherfuckers. No one cares going on five years. Five years makes you native now. Well, that's you didn't know that's the rule. I didn't. That's the rule of gentrification. Okay. I Mac and I that do the sports show, we preach walk away. The red zone. Yeah. On the red zone, we preach walk away. Don't try to get an argument, walk away. Unless you're really prepared to go all the way, walk away. And I don't know what other people are capable of. So, again, unless you're prepared to go all the way, just walk away. Yeah, I'm going to be somebody else will drag me away type of girl. That's hot Cheeto behavior. It is. Definitely. Hot Cheetos in you. That's some hot Cheetos. I don't know of like the hot Cheetos and then the generic puffs now. Oh, but you got it. If it gets to the point where it's heated, all right, you know what? I got to walk away. You know why? Because I don't know any better. And I'm not going to jail. I'm not going to jail. I'm not going to jail. I'm not going to jail. That's something we should all try to avoid, honestly. Right? I'm not going to jail. But another reason why you walk away is because you don't want to get clowned this hard in front of your kids. I mean, they already don't respect you at 10 or 12. Damn, man. Imagine if your daddy got clowned this hard in front of you. How is he going to? Hey, man, you better pick up your toys. For what? I'll get that nigga from across the street. Come here and straighten your shit out, bitch-ass dad. Call him a pussy for an hour. Yeah, dude. Fuck it. How are you going to get punked in front of me and mom? Come on, man. He's not even my real dad. My real dad wouldn't have let that shit ride. Or so I heard. My real dad's in prison. So I heard. I'm not paying securities any fucking money. Oh, shit. Tony Spezzi here with Triple A Heating Cooling. In the last five years, most of our competitors have become total sellouts, man. Literally. Private equity has swept through Portland, gobbling up most of the locally owned heating and cooling companies, leaving corporate wreckage in their wake. At AAA Heating and Cooling, we're still family-owned and not going anywhere. We have Portland roots, not corporate suits. What do you say? Hey, hey, hey, AAA Heating and Cooling. CTV number 222. Oh, that's so great. Bray says there can only be one, and it's that dude. I'm telling you, if it has gotten to this level in front of your kids, I got to a first-row seat to a brawl in Walmart in the infant section between two pregnant women. I think it went something like, Bitch, I'll fight you even though I'm pregnant. Bitch, I'm pregnant too. Oh, I'm like, okay, we gotta get home, kids. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah, come on. Nothing's good finna happen. Nothing good is finna happen. And that's my point. If it gets to the, look, you see the once you once, first of all, your girl's got hot Cheetos all in her fingers when she pulled the phone out. When she pulled the phone out, one of two things is going to happen when you pull the phone out. If you're talking to somebody with sense, they're going to run away. You're talking to a motherfucker like this, he wants to make the news. And if your hot Cheeto-fingered female pulled her phone out, he's going to make the news and he's going to make the news kicking your ass because you didn't leave the house ready for that smoke. Hot Cheeto women can definitely get you in trouble, but they can also humiliate you. I was, I actually took my younger daughter to her first 49ers game last season. And we were waiting in the five-hour long line to get out of the parking lot. And this guy very nicely, I was with my father and my stepmother. This guy very kindly led us into a line because we were in a parking spot where we couldn't actually get like at the end of the line. You know what I mean? Very kindly let us in. And this woman behind them lost her shit, got out of the car and starts trying to open the door to get to the guy that let us in, right? So his friend gets out of the car. and she's screaming all this stuff and so they see that her boyfriend is about to get out of his car these are big dudes that let us in so the one of the dude just comes around while she's screaming hanging in the door comes around to their car and just leans on the boyfriend's door so he can't open it oh i so wish i would have recorded this because it was probably one of the funniest things i've ever seen i mean like they were just completely humiliated in front of a parking lot full of drunk 49er fans but the niner would you this is at the new stadium of course yep well even the new stadiums were that didn't the dude get killed or they beat the shit out of him in the bathroom a few years ago there's niner fans are the worst there's something about drinking and football that just makes us all kind of stoop look man i i was at a you remember brandon johnson he's my year i do me and brandon johnson i believe will was there and another guy you don't know we We were at a Bronco game in San Diego because me and Brandon are huge Bronco fans. And we had these nosebleed seats way up at the top. This is the old stadium. What's it called? Qualcomm. But it was that you can just fall out of at the top. Yes. It was like the Niner Stadium. If you got shitty, the old candlestick, if he had shitty seats at the old candlestick, if you leaned forward too much, you would fall over. Apparently, all the nigga Bronco, Neek, sorry, Negro Bronco fans were in these seats because there was a bunch of us, right? There was a bunch of us. And there was a dude about three or four rows up. And I don't even think he was drunk. But he leaned over and he fell. And we saw a dude. If you don't believe me, ask Will, ask Brandon. I swear to God. We saw a dude just like zoom. He just a grown man just like, did you see a dude? And we looked down and the dude fell into the lap of a white family. I mean, he was safe, but he was kind of on his back. And he was like, ah. And there was a little girl. And the little girl was like, ah. And then the dad was like, you know, again, they knew it wasn't on purpose. And he was okay. And the dad made sure he was okay. You know, the guy apologized to the family and everybody applauded. And everyone was happy. The white family was so happy. They caught a black guy or whatever. And it was literally raining, man. There's a song about that, isn't there? It's not like this. And it was such a peaceful outing because it was in San Diego. I know what you're saying. I know what you're saying, but I can honestly say, after if that happened in Oakland, that man would have had to die. Even if it was. I mean, the little girl would have beat the shit out of him. Yes. That man would have had a hot one in his ass. A drill though. A drill though. You're not the one. I am the one. You would have got that fucking speech as they were all kicking his ass. Like, yeah, it's not, it's not where you want to be when Jesus comes. Yes, without color. I like nice hair when I could rub my fingers through it. You know what I mean? Okay. White women, hair, silky. Black women, nappy wigs, falling all off at the club. You know what I mean? Driving. Okay, they're on off. I'm going to ask you to leave if you can't be respectful. So, this, you know, those balloon pop shows? Wait, no. You don't know the balloon pop shows? Are you fucking with me? No. Oh, I almost never watch TV. Sweet summer child. I have some programming for you. So, balloon pop shows is like there's either a man or a woman, right? The men are women. So if it's a bunch of men, they all have a balloon, and a woman comes out. If they don't think the woman, whatever, then they pops the balloon and the same thing. Women pop the balloon if they don't like the guy. It's pretty shitty. But this guy has a specific balloon pop show where he pairs up people that never get on TV. So he has like elderly people, and that episode was snow bunnies and black dudes. But that black dude was actually super disrespectful. The other black dudes kind of felt like they didn't think it was real, so they were kind of like, uh, like, is this real? Like, you really have all these white women that want to bang a black guy. None of them had nose rings, but there is a Russian. There's a Russian woman, though, that asked the black dude how big his dick is here. Here, does she have a Russian accent, though, so it's cute, or no? I don't. I think they do it this in LA, so she could be an actress. I doubt it, but here you go. You tell me. Um, you can be in my video. Are you saying video? Like, video. Oh, what video are you talking about? About adult video. Oh, oh, it's all coming together. Did you know that? Oh, wow. Okay. So, oh, okay. Fans, maybe you get it too now. Okay. Why'd you break for ours? What was that question? Why'd you break her heart? What was that question? Okay, okay. Oh, yes. Okay. So, what's the answer to her question? No, I'm good. I'm good. The answer is wrong. Okay, I gotta find the video before because she asked the dude how big his dick is. How long your size? I am 6'3. That's 1.9 something meters. I did the map. God, you're in mind size. She's Russian, but she sure knew how to ask that. She did not ask nothing. Oh, wow. Oh, my meat. Banana size. Oh, okay. Banana size. It's decent. So, no worries. I need to be okay. I got you. Did y'all translate that for her or something? Whoa. Why is it always produce? Decent. Why did she sound like a minion when she said that? You're the fucking despicable me. You were like, what the hell was she just saying? Yeah, she just literally asked dude how big his junk was. And that was the questions that she was asking before about how big his junk was. Yeah, that's so this is a balloon pop show. These, I will say, these are very different than the normal balloon pop shows. People pop it for the most frivolous reasons. But I will send you some balloon pop shows so you can get acquainted with. I'll send you the real ones. This is kind of a spoof on them. I'll send you the real ones, but you said you have to go. Soon, soon I need to. I'm supposed to be making dinner, and then I have a standing Pilates date with my daughter. Aw. Oh, yeah, it's wholesome shit after I've sat here saying pussy 27 times and go hang out with kids. Well, I mean, look, it's funny because these shows are ridiculous. Um, but this is dating. I mean, as real as it is, like, as real as any of these shows are, or is it actors? I don't know where he's getting these people from because, like I said, a lot of it, he is he'll have like goth. Like, this was a goth thing that he did. Um, so if you wear a white, get your balloon popped right away. If you're not like angsty and nihilistic, say bye to your balloon. Oh, dude, this chick right here, clown this guy. I'm gonna see this guy here. Watch, Molly Cruel 24, and why it broke my heart is because you're corny. The way that you said that like you're a family man and also that you need a mother, go to therapy. But I can have freaky sex at therapy late. Uh, that's not helpful, if anything. Um, yeah, what else are you gonna ask me? Is he someone that's your type aesthetically? No, I don't like posers that name one kiss song, name one kiss song. Uh, I want to rock and roll a night. Uh, no, no, no, you know the whole lyric, I just don't know the name of it. It's a lyric, it's not the song's called. Okay, I was listening to Kiss this morning, so I was made for loving you. You know, I won's a Detroit Rockson. He didn't even need to wear kids shirt to have anyway, but I knew the lyrics. So, he's not, is she someone that's your type, aesthetically? Hell yeah, she is. Look at her. I like getting bullied. I think it's fun. So, yeah. Kiss is not good. Give me domination. That guy likes to get his nuts stomped on. I mean, apparently, but here's the thing. Why is she giving him a hard time about not remembering the title? Like, who the fuck remembers titles to songs? That's why we have apps like Shazam or whatever the fuck it's called. I can never remember the title. I'll sing the lyrics into that, which I know doesn't work for you because you can never remember the lyrics either. But still. Oh, I fuck lyrics. You know, I fuck lyrics. Yeah, we've had long conversations about lyrics. Like, I'm a professional lyric fucker-upper. Like, I've been. I mean, that's Ben and Larry. Like, it's Ben and Stanley. Damn it. Okay, fine. Ben and Stanley. Ben and Stanley. That was a good one. He. I love that you didn't actually get called out on that until you were an adult. This woman says she. I understand. Was it like Ty or something like that? It was Kevin Patterson. Kevin Patterson. Kevin Patterson on I-80 going west. Please tell me you were in El Serrito. No, we were on I-80 leaving the Panola. I think we were leaving Hercules. We were seeing some friends in Hercules and we were coming back and that song came on the radio. Radio. We were in his mom's car because he didn't have his own car at the time. I'll never forget this. And I was yelling it out in the passenger seat. And Kevin looked at me and goes, Nigga, what did you say? I said, Ben and Stanley. Nobody said Ben and Stanley lost their lives. I was like, who the hell are they? He goes, man. Every time I fucked up a song lyric, I found out because I was in the car with Kevin Patterson singing at the top of my lungs. And then he said, and I know Kevin Patterson just looked at you and flipped a bitch and just dropped your ass off back there. No, he told everybody around that I ruined those song lyrics because as he should have. That is exactly. That's actually how I sing that song now. Ben and Stanley lost their lives. And you got it because that's how it sounded to me because that was just sounded so ghetto. When you hear the Stevie Wonder, the real version, he enunciates a lot better. But this woman says she wants a black man that has money. Hi, my name is Sammy. I'm 25. I love black men who have money and I'm looking for a role. Oh, is your kid a boy or a girl? He's a boy. He's a boy. Does he like the hoop? Yeah. He loves football too. Cool. So are you willing to step up and be kind of a stepdad, even though is there baby daddy drama? No. Lies. Lies. Total lies. She's a cheater. Lies. She's like, I love black men with money. I like any man with money. I like women with money. I just want the fucking money. Like, what? Who is surprised by this? I hate to be that dude. I mean, come on, man. You're going to, hey, dude, I know you think you're charming and cute, but you're not. She thinks you have money. This lady is Jason's exact type. It really is, especially if she turns into like a refrigerator at like 35. It's not true. She's too young. 25. I'm not trying to hear 25. I need 35. You know my motto: if the nipples don't hang low, then you've got to go. If they don't point down, I'm not around. I have, I have my standards. If you don't have back pain, low standards. We can't talk. If you don't have sciatica, I'm not the dude for you. Look, I mean, that's fantastic, right? Like, especially for people that are over 45. They're like, but here's the thing: doesn't that mean that like when you bring someone home and you've led with that, they're like totally comfortable like farting in front of you and like pulling out their like air lax and their fucking yes, that's you know, that's what look that's the foundation of a strong relationship. Someone says, if you can't comb it out, Jason will pout. And he doesn't mean the hair on your head. If you don't have a fro, I'm not your bro. I love the champagne room chat. The red says, if the butt is not long, you must move along. Yes. Those are great. All of these people should be writing my dating profile. Please. You are asking people that are so excited to step up to the challenge. And if you guys, look, I will forward Jessica anything you guys create. And look, within reason, for her dating profile. School of fish. Yes. School of fish. Make it somewhat oceanic. Damn. Now they're just getting mean. If you're not Filipina, Jason's going to leave you. That's so painful. That's so painfully. Oh my God. You people are mean. Look, I hope you guys put this same fire into writing a dating profile for Hessica. Yes, please. Because it's going to be fucking hilarious. It's got to be better. Than my last dating profile, though. Um, were you serious on it on the dating profile? Totally. Oh, yeah. My little byline was: I enjoy long walks through the valley of the shadow of death and burning-covered bridges. Oh, Jesus! They thought she was real. We got a real one, they thought she was like Pac. Well, the people that weren't like understanding of sarcasm were like, You seem really angry. Oh, 49 years old, and I'm on school of fish, bitch. Of course, I'm angry. I'm so glad that y'all call this shit school. So, Jessica, this is a before you go. This is a real balloon pop show. Okay, this is the real OG one. This got picked up on Netflix. Um, but here it is. And I warn you, it's so ridiculous and vapid. Your name, my name is Leah. Leah, how old are you? Damn, what why? It's a pretty name, it's an attractive young lady. No nose ring, no nose. Well, over there, see why he ended up popping your name and age. My name is Wynn, I'm 35. And uh, when why'd you end up popping your balloon? She's not my type, and I didn't want to give her a chance at all. Shit, does he have someone that's your type? No, where's the beef gum? One's like his cheek, he looks too young for snuff, so it's got to be the hamburger gum, right? Dude, I don't know what homie's problem is. Another thing about this show is people want virality, so there's there's outrageous behaviors kind of encouraged in the just this model of the show. So, I think this young lady was being sincere. I just, she's like, hi, because you can tell by the way she's holding the microphone, she's extremely nervous. This is nerve-wracking. And to have some dude be such a doucher, you can tell I'm a dad. I want to see the one go viral where the bitch just flips her shit and like grabs the pin and just starts stabbing people. That'll go. Oh, well, there's one where a chick just starts popping everybody's balloon. That would be me. Just for shits and giggles. So here's the suave dude. Look at the suave dude trying to be suave. I'm 32 and I'm looking for a baddie, to be honest. That's what I'm looking for out of the relationship because I dated a lot of girls. And for me, the baddies really know how to take what I could. He's literally saying, I'm looking for some hot Cheeto shit. And if you're not going to be a fucking nightmare where my mom calls me and says, leave that woman. She's in my yard again. Yeah. Like, first of all, like, I know, and also that's lame-ass game by not popping the balloons, but I'm looking for a baddie. Like, you're trying to have her be like, oh, I want you because you said I was pretty and you think I have a little self-esteem. Like, you're kind of a shitty dude. But like, it was come on, dude. It was an awkward double entendre with the I want to see if they could take what I'm giving. Yeah, like, what are you giving? You're only giving six inches a day. Are you eating coupons? Are you giving a coupon? Or are you giving me candy? Because both of those things I would take in a heartbeat. I'll just keep your balloon. I love coupons. Tony Red said this shit makes me want to cry. Damn you, Jason. But I don't care. I am now going to have you pop one balloon. I'm right over this nigga right here to call me ugly. All right. So, why was your balloon unpopped? My balloon was unpopped because I was looking to see if she could measure up to the bar that I have set. And it does not appear so. Book of is who the fuck? That's how these balloon pop shows are. They're fucking horrible. I mean, it really, the only entertaining thing about this is that we're watching it in the champagne room. Treya says, Show the one where the guy said he was going to dunk the chick in the water. Yeah, this woman has makeup on. You could tell this man, I think he just got out. And she was like, she was a nice woman, and she didn't pop his balloon. And he was like, you know what? And she's like, you know what? I would do on a date? I would take you to like a hot tub and I would dunk your head underwater and I'd get all that makeup off your face so I can see what your face looks like. And I'm like, isn't there an easier way to do that? Like pawn cold cream or a fucking wipe? Or something, why does it have to be? I'm gonna damn near drown you in a hot tub spoon simulating assault. See what your reaction is. This is when your rap career has been fledgling for like 15-20 years. Wait, no, somebody's asking for the McRib video before I go, and I concur. What is the you made that shit up, man? I didn't just like Google like Lady has a meltdown about McRib in the parking lot. I swear to God, you'll get it. Well, then you have to do play-by-play for this while I find it. No, I can't. Wanna go platinum mama who used to get it, get it, get ludicrous on the track, get back, trick, twitch on a lack of fact. Same price every time, hot zone dumped on because he ever got sex up still. And I keep the theme, it's clean, it's bad, it's feeling on stainless wheels. This is what happens when you still haven't made it, quote unquote, at 38. I mean, she's not 38. Oh, he's 38. That's bad baby in 30 years. Bahad, baby, yes, I didn't want to say it that way because it sounds wrong. Oh, I think I found your video. You'll know it. Hold on, hold on. God damn you, mother whore. I thought this was the pussy hour. Who said that? You? About the hour that we get to say pussy over and over again. Say verging off into the mother whore thing. Uh, well, because I'm trying to pull the video up and everything paused on me. Oh, I think this is a bit, but I'm not sure because I don't think this is a real person. I refuse to believe this. I'll be able to tell you as soon as it comes on the screen. I've watched the McRib lady many, many times. Nope, that's her. This is her? Yeah, I don't think this is real. You can't hear her. Oh, you can't hear it? Okay. For some reason, it does that. What? Okay, can you hear me? Yep. Okay. It does this thing for some reason. Now you can see it, right? Yep. Okay. I have an announcement to make to y'all to the people of America. I was at this here McDonald's on Dorset. It's Monday night. I was just disrespected in there. Almost got in a fight with the gal in there. First of all, my first issue is the drive-through was filled all the way up and I had to walk inside. So then I'm, you know, I'm already mad because I got to get out of my car and go inside. So I go inside, I politely say, Hey, can I have a McRib meal? Large size with the Dr. Pepper. And the lady said, okay, that'd be $6.58. I said, Ain't you forgetting something, ma'am? And she said, well, what? I said, you're supposed to offer me the extra McRib for a dollar when you buy the McRib meal. It's really important. You ain't gonna believe it. Me up and down. And she said, Well, don't look like you need the extra McRib. Excuse me, bitch. I come from you, bitch. I knocked her ass down. So if you come to the Dorset McDonald's and you see a lady named Charlene in there, tell her Carla sent you. Damn. Shout out to Carla. Shout out to Carla. Honestly, shout out to the woman who was just fed up with her job and was like, Bitch, you're too fat for a fucking McRib. For an extra McRib. Always say, Excuse me, before you call someone, bitch. Where do you guys think this is? I feel like this guessing. Oh, that would be offensive, wouldn't it? Well, I'll guess because I've been to all the shitty places. That's fair. And where are we? Do you have to go? Are you still here? You're still good. I do have to get going. I am so sorry. All kinds of fun. Some lovely human invited me to the next movie night. When's the next movie night? I won't do that. No, you're not coming to the next movie. Okay. You tell them to, you tell them. You tell them to hook you up. No, you can tell them. Uh, I was gonna do a movie night tomorrow. I'm not sure. It depends what happens. Uh, I will be visiting at prison tomorrow. Yeah, maybe the next movie night. We can watch a jailbreak. Conair. We'll be watching no prison. Nope. Blood in, blood out. Damn. Damn. American me. Is that where Del Roy Lindo plays a very unconvincing BGF leader? Yep. That is. I can't. That is exactly what Del Roy Lindo plays in that movie. It's a very unconvincing BGF. I mean, he is. He's very unconvincing. He's really obsessed with his comb. And I'm like, you know what? I don't think there's really a thing in prison. He's like, say what it is. You have some fine finds there, Mexican man homie. I don't think that's how they talk. Like, what? Anyway. Well, before I'm sorry to have to go. Well, I just want you to know that Dave Chappelle made a joke many years ago about having Botox for your balls. And I found out that there's a thing called scrotox. It is real. It is real. I mean, that's okay. They call, what did they call it? Vaginoplasties. They now call them mommy makeovers. Well, you know another thing? The puffing. Vagina puffing. You can puff out your your labia, get it puffed up. Get it puffed out get it big and puffy that's a thing that's a thing and so is scroto fingernails it's like along those lines you know the duck tail with the I was always confused by those because you know those people that have like those smashed spoon thumbs that's what the little ducknails look like to me I'm like why would you want to make your why would you pay to have your nails look like you have a genetic disorder why would you get scrotox i mean maybe your girl likes it i've never met a woman that was like can you get your balls a little more rounder a little smoother clumps them a little bit yeah i would never i could i would never i would never there's nothing i couldn't say you know i joke a lot on this show like probably to a fault which is fine but i'm not gonna look if i'm with someone i think they're attractive i don't want them to change right sure i'm not gonna be like oh could you you know get a boob lift so you can look younger while i look like an old piece of yeah because the real reason that we're not asking at this age any of our partners to change anything because we don't want them to ask us i don't want you to ask me yeah can you no no i can't i can't put so i want to look like a homeless person when i'm sitting on your couch watching a movie on a saturday night and i don't give a fuck what you say about it you better find this attractive because it's all it is right you're gonna be like these are my they're not even my don't touch me pants. These are just my pants now. So exactly. I'm at the point now where i actually go on dates in my don't touch me pants because why don't why think that this is what it's going to be in two weeks. You might as well know up front. It's a courtesy. It's like a public service announcement. This is actually how bad I look at home. You're like, I didn't clean any of the dog hair off. This is what I'm doing. I didn't even brush my fucking teeth. Damn. But it can only go up from here. Damn. I do have to bid you farewell. I have to catch a very early flight tomorrow morning. It has been an absolute pleasure. Thank you, Jason. Thank you. Hey, seriously, thank you for spending time with us. It's been a long time, and you're always welcome on movie night. Have a good one. Have a safe place. I will take you up on it. Take care. Peace. Very nice woman. Very nice woman that Jessica. But she doesn't know about Scrotox. Scrotox is a procedure where Botox or any other brand is injected into the skin of the scrotum. This can help reduce excessive sweating in the area. It can also help relieve painful spasms and smooth out. Who's had ball spasms? If I had a ball spasm, I would feel like it's time to see a real doctor and not just look up on WebMD. Like, seriously. Says that she goes to movie night. Drea, you totally go to movie night with the dog hair on you. Yeah, Red says, Who is having ball? Who has ball spasms? That sounds like a fucking nightmare. If my balls are doing weird Harry Potter shit in my pants, um, it's insane. It's in fucking sane. And I don't want to smooth them out. The wrinkles to give for a more relaxed, fuller appearance in the area. The scrotum houses the testicles, and the testicles produce sperm. Under the scrotal skin is the dartose muscle. The dartose muscle is a smooth muscle, meaning it is involuntary and it is for thermoregulation. When it's cold outside, it contracts, and when it's warm outside, it relaxes to give the optimal temperature to the testicles for sperm production. When this area is injected with Botox, this muscle relaxes, it reduces the appearance of wrinkles, and it can make the area appear. I don't believe a word she's saying. First of all, you're going to cool my nuts. Now you're going to warm my nuts. What kind of cock thermos are you putting on my ball bag? That's the real million-dollar question we have here. Because it sounds like you're creating some sort of MCDLT of testicles. What does it do to the hog? Does it keep the hog thicker? Let me know. Are you going to inject that so it hangs a little lower? Because it's going to really suck if I have massively smooth, huge nuts in a brand new coin purse. And now it looks like I got a baby dick because I got these new, huge, smooth meteorite testicles. So, you're gonna yank me out so I can have an elephant trunk? What are you doing, Doc? Do I have to pay extra for that? Let me know because just smooth. I just realized my kitchen window is open so my neighbors can hear all this. Dreams I would not date a guy who did this. Imagine some dude whipping his crank out, and you're like, dude, why are your nuts so big and smooth? Is that okay? Are you okay? Should I call a doctor? Someone says Jason's landlord wants to have a word with him in this passionate conversation. He's having this doctor. I'm serious, dude. Who the fuck does this? I want to meet the guy that's like, I don't know. My nuts, they could be better. They could be better. It's just what they are. It's just what they are. They're not getting any. You're not getting any better. Is she going to shoot more testosterone in those motherfuckers for you to fill them out? Like, let me know. Hey, can you fill these nuts up with some tests? And when I don't get angry for no reason and weird back acne, maybe I'll sign up for it then. But I don't care. No woman cares. Like, having smooth nuts is just going to make you be like, oh, well, my dick's not long enough. And they're going to get your cranks stretched out. And then your butthole's not going to be right. Oh, I've been eating spicy food for the last 45 years. Maybe I should get my butthole tightened. For what? For what? What 48-year-old woman is eating all that ass? Like, seriously. And who is bothering eating your 48-year-old ass and going, your butthole looks like it's been worn a bit? Did you have a. You like pegging or something? You're not telling me? No, I'm just old. I know we're the same age, but I just don't like old guy buttholes. Can you get a young guy butthole? Like, who's having that sex conversation in their 40s? If you're having that sex conversation, leave a fucking comment because I have so many more questions for you. You are an interesting being, and I have to examine so much just for my own self-interest. Zyr said, vintage ass. Drea, you've been a woman for a minute now. You've even had a few children. So you've seen your Sherrick Cox. Did you ever think once in your life when you were face-to-face with him, things, which this guy had better nuts? Maybe it'll work. If his nuts were just better. If his nuts were better. Don't worry about the wrinkles in your nutsack. Worry about the attachment issues you had when you walked into the relationship. Worry about your insecurities that you project on your loved ones. Fix that shit. Nuts are nuts. Labias are labias. I've never met a man at my age. When you're young, you say a bunch of horrible things that aren't true. Oh, no, her labias are just too loose. Word? That's why you broke up with her? We're 50, Bill. That's why it's not going to work because her labias are loose. Interesting. Have you shaved your ass in the last decade? I'm sure if she tried to grab your butt, it would be like trying to pick up gum at a fucking movie theater. It's the hair and weird shit. You're gross, Bill. You're a gross man. You shouldn't talk about people's labias. That's not it. Maybe if my cock was longer, she'd love me. Hmm, maybe. But if so, she sucks. If anyone's going to like you more, if you're going to get more confidence because of the smoother scrotum, I don't think you're addressing the real problems. There's some root causes that we're ignoring here. It's not your dick. And you know what? A lot of times, it's not even your wallet. It's not. I've seen some little dick dudes very happy in loving relationships. And this is the real reason for Jason's current obsession with caked up little women. Zahir says, You don't understand, Jason. If I can get rid of every wrinkle and every hair, I can be the ultimate smoothness and live forever. If you're trying to relive your youth, let that shit go. Let it go, let it go. You're gonna fuck around and mess with a hoe. Trust me. Trust me. We saw that shit the other night. Saw a cat with a woman way younger. She looked like she was on a prowl, too. Didn't give a fuck about Paul Paul. Off air, Jessica and I were talking about not wanting to be with younger people. That's like a big reason for me. Like, I don't want to, first of all, it's just not a lot we have in common. But no, I'm going, I'm going down in life, right? I'm sore. I can't eat certain foods past a certain time. Uh, Just physically, I'm on the decline, and that's where we're supposed to be as we're preparing to die. If you're 25, everything is really starting to move in the right direction for you. Um, and you don't need to waste your perky titties on me. I don't want you to, as a matter of fact, go go waste them on someone else. Just, I don't, whatever you're looking for, I can't provide it. A dad, money, whatever you are looking for, it ain't with me. Red says going out with a 25-year-old sounds exhausting. Um, yep, yep, it is, it is. I dip my toe, I dip my toe in the water, wasn't for me, just couldn't do it with a straight face. You're larger, however, caution must be taken as this can affect thermoregulation and sperm production, and it can affect fertility. I don't offer this procedure in my practice, and I caution against people who want to get it for purely aesthetic reasons. So, why should people get scrotox, doc? What is the good reason for scrotox? That's what I want to know. Like, what is the reason where it's like, oh, yeah, this is just a really good thing to get. Um, I have been sharing Amanda Seals videos with people that was a nightmare. I have fun second day. It was awkward, TBH. I understand. Sorry, I made things awkward. It wasn't you, Christian. I recognize the photos in your home. I bought him for your dad. I bought him for your dad. And he's the best I ever had. This is awkward. I bought him for your dad. That was awesome. Tony says, Man, he made me call my daddy the other day. Damn. Yeah. It's woof. Yeah. This guy that turns conversations into songs are pretty funny. Because, yeah. That's like that's a certain kind of talent. It's kitschy, but I do think it takes a certain kind of talent to do that. So I respect that, dude. Your name and age, and what agenda popping your balloon. My name is Destiny. I'm 30. I pop because from the eyebrows down, you ate that up, but the hair. What's wrong with my hair? It gave me what's that movie, Don't Be a Menace? Do we, you know, it don't matter. Oh, it takes the hair. It's on my light. It's a little much for me. But if that's you, express yourself, you know? Okay. Is she someone that's your type? She's straight. But at the end of the day, I'm going to still do what I want in my hair because I put that on. As you should. Yeah, I'm a bad bitch, too. So, yeah, no doubt about that. I don't even know what to say to that. That's where we are. That's where we are, America. That's where we are. Red says, I think it's a little much for everyone. Yeah. Yeah. The kind of picking any braids is a bit much, I thought. But I could be wrong. Tell me if I'm wrong. People that watch this tell me, it's oh, no, Jay, you totally got it wrong. This is what's hot in the street. This is what we're doing with our hair right now. That's for Mac. Where did it go? Oh, this is the funniest shit in the world. This came out in 1993, and it's still very accurate. We can leave with this. This class is a travesty. That poor woman child is just another victim of the patriarchy. She is. I am. Hate crime. Hate crime. Not only that, it is also a racist construct. This woman represents the same white image of beauty that has oppressed women for centuries. Hate crime, hate crime. Where are the nude models of color? The people of girth, the handycapable, the elderly, the queer. Sorry, it's just naked, fat, black, crippled dykes are hard to find. That is the only right answer to that question. I could be wrong. I'm sorry I said that. I apologize. You white male. Stop trying to co-op my black anger. I'm just trying to understand your black anger. Show it to me again. Thank you. I understand now. Sir, you leave me only one alternative. I must walk out and call for a boycott of your classes. Anybody who stays is obviously a racist. Shut up. This class is a trap. That's rough because it's just so on the fucking nose. But Tony says, show it to me again. Again? Okay, one more time. That poor woman, child, is just another victim of the patriarchy. She is? I am. Hate crime, hate crime. Not only that, it is also a racist construct. This woman represents the same white image of beauty that has oppressed women for centuries. Hey, crime, hate crime. Where are the nude models of color? The people of girth, the handy capable, the elderly, the queer. Sir, it's just naked, fat, black, crippled dykes are hard to find. I'm sorry I said that. I apologize. You white male. Stop trying to co-op my black anger. I'm just trying to understand your black anger. Show it to me again. Shut up. Thank you. I understand now. Sir, you leave me only one alternative. I must walk out and call for a boycott of your classes. Anybody who stays is obviously a racist. What's sad is that that's how long we've been having the same conversation. Like, this was funny literally 32 years ago, and it hasn't changed. There's someone right now that thinks they're really edgy saying similar words, and it's like, oh, yeah, people had that argument 32 years ago. Now it's online. Thank you guys for hanging out with me. Thank you again, Jessica, for coming on the show and hanging out in the champagne room. I forgot that she actually has had carrot raisin salad because she's a vegetarian. It's like fucking nothing she can eat. And imagine she was teasing my homemade caramel for breakfast. It's a true story. True story. No, she's not a vegan. She's a vegetarian. With vegan-like tendencies. Again, thank you guys so much. I'll see you. Rikusha says, I want the caramel sauce she talked about. Tony says, even froth is real. And she knew me when I had the steam froth, when I had the espresso machine, so I was like steaming it. So you get latte art in that bitch. So it's a different time, Tony. It's a different time. I don't have that espresso machine any longer. Thank you guys. And I'll see you sooner than later. Maybe if you guys are down, we can watch Mad Max. I think I'm going to drop the Patreon article on Substack. I've had a Substack so I could read other people's substacks, but I never put anything on it. And it's like, oh, and I published things on people's subjects. Anna Casparian substack, I have something. Ben Substack, I have something. And so I just started putting these out there because, eh, why not? I used to be able to make like a magazine version of them. I don't think I was able to tell you guys this. So we used to, or I used to make a magazine-formatted version of the articles. And I couldn't do it for the last one because Patreon stopped supporting that format. It really sucks because I did all it takes hours to do it. And some people actually were nice that they're like, oh, I'll buy the magazine version. But yeah, Patreon doesn't support that anymore. So it's just the text only. So I was like, oh, let's put it on this fucking Substack thing for free. I don't want to ever have people pay for a Substack thing because it's just too much to just pay one thing. I sound like an old person, and that's okay. Come for the footwear fascism, stay for the corn caramel sauce. Wow, footwear fascism. That's what you guys call it. Gotcha. All right. So, if you guys are down, you know, just drop a comment in Patreon and say, Yeah, let's watch Mad Max. I mean, the original Mad Max. So, you can really understand the article. You'll understand the quotes because I'm sure people haven't seen the original in a long time. It's actually a better movie than people think. It's a really exciting movie. The way they shoot Tarantino is right. The way Australians shoot cars, and especially those 70s movies, was like next level. So, you really feel like you're there. So, it's a fun movie. If you guys are down, let me know. Peace. Tony Spezza here with AAA Heating and Cooling. The heat is here and you're dragging that sad inflatable pool out from the garage. If your actual AC system is leaking and barely holding on, maybe it's time to give us a call. AAA Heating and Cooling. CCB number 222.
