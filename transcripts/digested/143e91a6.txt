Tony Spezzi here with AAA Heating and Cooling. The heat is here, and you're doing your best to cool off, dragging that sad, inflatable pool out from the garage. You know, the moldy ones slowly leaking onto your lawn while the kids scream. Yeah, it's a vibe. If your actual AC system is acting like an inflatable pool leaking and barely holding on, maybe it's time to give us a call. We'll help you stay cool without the tarp or the panic. AAA Heating and Cooling. CCB number 222. Good evening, everyone. I'm your host, Jason Miles, here for another episode of This Is Revolution podcast. If you are new to the channel, welcome.

Not just the special Monday night dudes in the cheap seats show, but also those who joined us for that marathon movie night. I think we hung out with Derek Varn for like another three or four hours after we watched video violence. It was a good time, and the replay is soon to be up. The replay is up from Mad Max, which we watched on Sunday. We've been watching a lot of movies. I hope you guys appreciate this. I will say that not all of the post-conversation is there. Sometimes you just got to be there. But we are going to be doing another cheap seats coming up in September. So keep a lookout for that. And of course, more movie nights. If you'd like to join us for these movie night watch parties or champagne room shenanigans, there is one easy way. Become a patron or a paid YouTube subscriber. You'll get access to the champagne room. Join us for movie nights. And as a patron, if you can't make it, you'll get to watch the movie night replay filled with all of the in-movie banter of the TIR family. By becoming a paid YouTube subscriber or a patron, you can make sure TIR can continue to stay on the air, producing irreverent, intelligent, and insane programs like this. And you're not here for me to pitch the Patreon. You're here to listen about why heat kills. In the summer of 1995, Chicago endured a devastating heat wave. Over the course of five sweltering days, more than 700 largely elderly and low-income residents perished. Many unable to afford air conditioning and further hampered by power outages. And insufficient emergency services. Three decades later, we face analogous, I can't talk, analogous threats, not driven solely by meteorological extremes, but by systemic policy failures in a bipartisan war on the poor. As our guest today, Kenny Stancl argues in Heat Kills, Trump has ensured there will be more victims. The Trump administration's recent cuts are accelerating a crisis that was already decades in the making. Federal and state governments of both parties have long prioritized balanced budgets and corporate subsidies over resilient public infrastructure, leaving vulnerable communities exposed to climate shocks. Now, with Trump and congressional Republicans gutting environmental protections, dismantling climate research, and expanding fossil fuel consumption, those vulnerabilities are turning deadly on a mass scale. This bipartisan consensus, one that targets poor people through austerity, punitive housing, and welfare policy, and disinvestment in public health, has created a landscape where climate change magnifies inequality and death. The illusion of fiscal prudence and efficiency only masks the dismantling of already fragile systems, systems that needed to be reimagined and fortified rather than torn apart. As our guest today makes clear, the outcome is not simply hotter summers, but a deliberately manufactured crisis in which the poor are made expendable. Wherever you are watching or later listening to this show, there is definitely a link in the description of Kenny's article. Now, please welcome a first-time guest here, Kenny Stancil. How are you? I'm doing well. It's great to be here. Thank you for having me. Hey, I'm glad Tara hooked it all up and put me in contact with you. I really enjoyed what you wrote. It forced me to go back and read about 1995 in Chicago, which the year I graduated high school 30 years ago, such a tragedy that happened. How does that 1995 Chicago heat wave illustrate the lethal impact of social and infrastructural inequality? Yeah, I think disasters in general, including but not limited to the Chicago heat wave of 1995, have a way of laying bare society's pre-existing injustice. And so, in the case of the Chicago heat wave, I think it reflected the city's already extreme inequality. And, you know, so when you look at the death toll and the geography of mortality, where were people dying, you could discern really clear patterns because the death toll and the geography of it all reflected, as I mentioned, you know, pre-existing inequality. And so I guess one thing that I just want to make clear is that, you know, there's no such thing as a natural disaster. I think when we use that phrase, we are basically letting off the hook all of the social, economic, and political forces that produce vulnerability. And so, in the case of Chicago, and I cite Eric Kleinenberg's heat wave because he makes a really clear case in that book that this neoliberal policymaking, which is really a precursor to the Doge blitz that we see today, that played in exacerbating mortality because the anti-welfare policies of the 1990s, the withdrawal of support, and also like the reinvention of trying, you know, turning citizens who have rights to public goods and social protection, turning them into customers who have to shop for different kinds of services, usually market-based, that left people more vulnerable to heat. As the death toll is being counted in Chicago, congressional Republicans were still trying to eliminate LIHEAP, the low-income home energy assistance program, which is just really crucial. Cruel and remarkably callous thing to do. And then the other, I think, important aspect of all this is neoliberalism has really ramped up atomization. It's made us more isolated and it's basically taken as wealth and power has been redistributed upward, responsibility for well-being has been pushed downward to the level of individual households. And so you really get this sense. And in practice, you see that people are basically left on their own, abandoned, and it's up to you to protect yourself. And that's just no way to run a society. And all of us are worse off because of that sort of policy prescription that we're still living with today. I think we'd both agree that the neoliberal consensus is a bipartisan consensus. In what ways do we see both parties have these long-term policies of austerity and privatization? In what way, I guess, would the Biden administration kind of be on par with what we're seeing with Trump? Because as you just said, you know, 95, this is the Clinton years. So in what ways is that kind of a part of the problem that we're talking about right now? That's a great question. It's a huge part of the problem. I realize that there is a danger in trying to basically like focus so intently on the Trump administration's culpability and the Republican Party's culpability, because that can actually blind us to the systemic source of our unjust and precarious status quo. And I agree with you 100% that this is a bipartisan problem. You know, if we could just like back up a little bit, Carter, Jimmy Carter in the mid-70s was the warm-up act for Reagan. And I think Reagan is oftentimes seen as the starting point of what I would call the neoliberal counter-revolution. And I think there's a lot of good sense why people would attribute the beginning of neoliberalism to Reagan, but there was, you know, already some of the anti-union, anti-welfare state, pro-deregulation policies had already been set in motion before Reagan. But Reagan certainly ramped up neoliberalism, took it to a new extreme and normalized it. But then Clinton, I think, is a really important part of the story here because Clinton, I would say, made neoliberalism hegemonic because he cemented it as a bipartisan ideology and policy regime in legitimate regonomics and honestly advanced some of the policies that Republicans hadn't been able to finish. And so, and there's no real break with neoliberalism. Bush, both Bushes are in ones before Clinton, one after. Obama was certainly a neoliberal president, Trump as well. I think with Biden, there's some confusion because Biden did take some steps, I think, to try to reverse some aspects of neoliberalism. I wouldn't say that he's an anti-neoliberal president. The irony with Biden, too, is that in the 90s, he was one of the new Democrats who I think was the most aggressive of in that party of, and I say new Democrats because they're the ones who explicitly define themselves in opposition to the New Deal Democratic Party of FDR. And so Biden went from being a quintessential neoliberal Democrat to someone who did actually take some steps to the trajectory. You know, certainly he was one of the more pro-union presidents of the past half century or more. But if we understand neoliberalism as using the state to facilitate the upward transfer of wealth, I don't think Biden, you know, there was no clean break with neoliberalism. Because even if you look at his signature policy achievement, the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains some good things in terms of trying to move us toward a clean energy economy, the problem is that instead of direct public investment and public provision, it was pretty much all carrot and no stick, just trying to tighten the private sector to invest in green technologies. And so, you know, a lot of people would refer to this as de-risking. And so I don't think it went nearly far enough. I'd rather. You know, it would be nice if there was a full-throated Green New Deal approach that tried to accomplish decommodification and decarbonization simultaneously. So I don't mean to downplay neoliberal Democrats' complicity in all of this. I certainly think this is a bipartisan problem. I would say five decades of bipartisan neoliberalization lie at the heart of so many of the problems that we're facing today. So, yeah, I'm with you there. I think one reason why it makes sense to focus on Trump is because I would say the Trump administration and his Republican accomplices in Congress and in the judiciary, I think they represent like a sort of high point of or a more extreme or aggressive form of neoliberalism. And so, in a way, I think, unlike Republicans, there are some Democrats, not nearly enough, a growing but sufficient number who are recognizing the need to pursue a pro-labor, pro-environment, downwardly redistributive alternative. And so, I think by focusing on the harms created by people like Trump and Musk's Doge wrecking crew, it's like an invitation basically to translate or sort of transform anti-fascism into anti-neoliberalism. Because if we see neoliberalism as sort of one of the reasons or what helped set the stage for right-wing authoritarianism, then it's not just enough to be against Trumpism. We need to be against the conditions that gave rise to Trumpism. So, it's like be against Trump's right-wing authoritarianism, his neoliberalism, and then take it to the next level and oppose the policies that gave rise to him. Do you think that's hard for a lot of people to do? Because there's this feeling of needing to be the quote-unquote resistance, which becomes these kind of rhetorical battles. And, you know, what you're talking about is something that I think is one of those things that hides in shadows, if you will. Because, you know, we have to be honest about who's really affected by climate deaths. You know, and I think even saying that, a lot of people turn off their ears. Because if you have AC in your car, if you have the ability to maybe leave town when it's going to be really hot, even if you don't have central air or something like that, or the ability to buy a swamp cooler, there's people that don't have those abilities. And I'm not even talking about our unhoused brothers and sisters. I'm just talking about the people that are managing to pay rent, but don't have the extra things when you get hit with a heat wave. What is it that the Democrats do that kind of hides in the shadows as well? Because we'll all be ready for the resistance and fight against this because Trump's in office. But let's just say, you know, Democratic person X gets in because they've played a better heel, right? Gavin Newsom gets in because he's he's the Patrick Bateman that's going to defeat the shit. I don't even know what Donald Trump is, the comic book bad guy from a Batman movie in the 80s. But what are his policies going to look like when it comes to these same things? Are they going to change? Do they even need a plan? Because we're also talking about a population that usually doesn't vote. So when you were talking, I actually had Gavin Newsome in mind because he's been so such a visible proponent of this war on homeless people. And so, yeah, you're right to highlight that I think the victims of heat waves tend to be considered expendable or disposable. And so, actually, I think the same day that my article came out in Jackman, I saw an estimate. You know, there's always a lag in reporting of heat-related deaths, and they're always undercounted because a lot of times what happens is people will attribute what is a heat-related illness or death or a heat-related death. They'll say that it was caused by some kind of underlying illness or other pre-existing condition. And so, The point I'm making, though, is this the same day that my article came out, I saw Maricopa County where Phoenix is. There was an estimate that in July or through the end of July, 400 people had died. And so I think that's like a clear instance of what you're talking about, where people who lack access to shelter are extremely vulnerable. And then even those who, you know, aren't unhoused, they're still not in the clear because air conditioning, access to air conditioning is so unequal. And then just like in the mid-90s, LIHEAP today, the low-income home and energy assistance program, is still at risk. You know, Trump's budget director, Russell Vogt, who, you know, is essentially, we can think of him as another Musk-like figure who is hell-bent on the remains of the U.S. of social protection in the U.S. and public good-oriented government. He called LIHEAP unnecessary. And so like this idea that I think there is a tendency that more affluent people don't see this as much of a crisis as it is because they think that, oh, everyone has access to the amenities that I have, cool housing and things like that. I guess one thing that maybe we should do to push back on that is just point out how much worse things are set to get soon. So in the article I cite, there's a really useful tool from the Union of Concerned Scientists called Killer Heat, and it includes an interactive dashboard with like a drop-down menu and a map. And you can type in any city or county and you can actually see how much worse things are going to get in the next 30 years and then the next 70 years. And the point is that even in people will think, oh, this isn't a big problem. And I guess we could extend that and say places where Democratic lawmakers think, oh, this won't affect my constituents very much. That's absolutely inaccurate. So we're going to go from a situation where certain places see heat indexes, a combination of heat and humidity above 90 degrees. That's going to skyrocket from 10 days a year to 50 days a year. And there's a misconception too. I think some people think the heat index has to be 100 or 105 for this to be dangerous. That's not true. The high 80s can be dangerous. And then when you turn up that temperature and you start talking about how many days are we going to see with heat indexes above 100 or 105, that's also going, it's just on this trajectory of going up, up, up to really unsustainable levels. And so anyone, any like lawmaker who thinks that this isn't going to affect huge swaths of society, I think is mistaken. And yeah, I think the issue that we're facing is that too many Democrats are, like their Republican counterparts, committed to advancing the interests of a minority of super wealthy benefactors, as opposed to advancing the interests of the vast majority of working class people who don't donate. Yeah. Yeah, they're basically trying to appease their donors. I get what you're saying. I think that's a huge problem. Well, yeah, I mean, when I was reading your piece, again, I think I went right to Chicago and I thought about my drive north. I live here in Baja, California in Mexico, and I drive up north to the Bay Area. So I go from one extremely temperate, beautiful climate to one slightly colder, beautiful, temperate climate. But in between, it's a lot of disgusting hot, right? Central California, once you leave San Diego, most of Southern California is pretty warm. And Bakersfield, until you get to the Bay Area, is just, it is Satan's rectum. It's just so disruptive. And you think about people that there's people that have water shortages in these places. And there's tons of reasons why we don't have to get into them. But I feel like the hundreds of thousands. Of people that live in these areas are in just in just my drive. I'm not even going to throw in everything west of that drive, which would be the Mojave area, southern Nevada, all of hot ass New Mexico and Arizona. Like, it's just, it doesn't cool off till you get to the Atlantic Ocean, really, especially this time of year. And to think that you're gutting certain protections that help this very vulnerable population, which is the elderly. Do you think we forget about the elderly when we think about these things? Like they don't exist anymore? Yeah, I think that that's definitely an overlooked population. And not only, like, especially this was this and elsewhere, but isolated elderly people and especially isolated poor elderly people are most at risk. And so that's another thing to worry about. You know, I was just talking about the trajectory that we're on in terms of the number of just unbearably hot days. We're also, you know, the United States and other countries are becoming older and becoming, and for a long time we've been becoming more isolated and atomized. And so, yeah, I think a lot of bad patterns are converging around the same time. One more thing, when you were talking about how, you know, dry it is, one of the things that we're doing right now in desert cities like Phoenix is building these AI and crypto data centers. And it's just the last thing we should be doing right now. And for multiple reasons. First of all, like most of them are going to be powered by fracked gas. And so that's adding more fossil fuel pollution to the atmosphere. Another thing is, with this rising levels of extreme heat, people are going to need, for everyone who has air conditioning, people are going to be running, you know, and using more electricity. That's going to run into the fact that these huge data centers are consuming vast amounts of energy to create just slop and to help students cheat and not really contributing anything positive to society. So you have this massive increase in electricity use from data centers, from people trying to stay cool. That's going to create more power outages and then, you know, just like this cascading failure. And those data centers also use vast amounts of water, not just electricity.

I do think that that is, yeah, a part of our population that is overlooked. And other bad things are happening to elderly people right now with the attack on Social Security, Medicare. So, yeah, things are very bleak right now, and people are getting hit from multiple angles at the same time. And, you know, I think the sensible thing to do would be to pursue a humane agenda that tries to reduce inequality and planet heating pollution at the same time. You know, one way to do that is Green New Deal-style politics that says we need to achieve the public provision of public goods. So, you know, make sure that we have universal access to green public housing. Clean energy should be, that should be something that's being pursued as a state-led clean energy transition. Because right now, with the way the IRA left it, you know, to market forces, that's really fragile. And we've seen already the Trump administration has completely reversed gains that were in motion. And it's not enough to just say, oh, well, solar and wind are getting cheaper, so they'll out-compete fossil fuels in the marketplace. That's just not the way it works. A lot of times, you know, when it comes to energy, the investor class is looking at where they can get the highest. Return and fossil fuels are more profitable. So, we need to think much more in terms of public-led policies, I think, to get us out of this mess. You emphasize the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure and the higher cost of energy as among the administration's choices. How do these decisions disproportionately impact low-income households and communities of color? And how does the bipartisan push for corporate friendly energy policy, whether fossil fuel expansion on the right or market-based green solutions on the center left, reinforce some of these class inequalities and access to affordable energy? Yeah. Well, the most simple way to answer this is just to address the basic reality of the climate crisis, which is that it's driven by rising greenhouse gas emissions, which are driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. And so, every time that our society opts to expand coal, oil, and gas over renewable sources of energy, that's a choice that is really condemning present and future generations to worse, more frequent, and more intense extreme weather. Every form of extreme weather is exacerbated by greenhouse gas pollution, and so and including extreme heat. And actually, one thing I forgot to mention with that killer heat tool from Union of Concerned Scientists, is you can look at different scenarios, like a scenario where we do reduce planet heating pollution and implement policies swiftly to cap warming at basically 1.5 degrees Celsius versus what happens if we just, like we're doing right now, just get on this runaway trajectory. And so every degree of warming that we can prevent makes a positive difference. So that's why fossil fuels, fossil fuel expansion is such a terrible thing to do. And then at the same time that Trump is facilitating fossil fuel expansion, you know, his administration and congressional Republicans are waging this war against clean energy. And the reason why that's going to drive up is already contributing to higher energy and electricity prices is because they're reducing the supply of energy at the same time that demand is increasing, either from people needing to stay cool or from these data centers that I mentioned earlier. And so we've got this increase in energy demand at the same time that they're artificially curbing the supply of our most our cheapest and most abundant forms of energy that also don't add carbon pollution. So that's, I think, just a really, you can just see the sort of idiocy of that energy policy there. And then as a mom, I spent years looking for quality nutrition my kids would actually enjoy until I found Kate Farm's Kids Nutrition Shake. Organic, plant-based goodness that my kids and I love. It's pediatrician approved and comes in three yummy flavors, strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla. The best part is it's now available in select target stores. My kids ask for it again and again, and it checks all my boxes. Find Kate Farms Kids Nutrition Shake at your local Target store or shop online at Target, Amazon, and KateFarms.com. I think the effects of everything that we're talking about-of extreme heat, of skyrocketing, energy costs, all of this is distributed according to pre-existing patterns of differentiated vulnerability and injustice and inequality. And so that's why the people who are affected or hit worse by this are low-income, living in poverty. And then, you know, in the United States, when we look at the composition of the working class here, you know, black and brown working people are more likely to be overrepresented among the poor. And that's why the distribution of these injustices looks the way that it does. And so I think that's also one of the reasons why we're not doing as much as we should be doing about this crisis is because most people might be surprised to learn that. Heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather. It kills more people than hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding combined. And that's even with the, you know, that's not even considering the fact that these deaths are undercounted. And I think the reason for that is because the victims of extreme heat are often, as I mentioned before, you know, expendable. They are some of the most subjugated members of the working class. They're the poorest, the most vulnerable. They might be homeless. They might be incarcerated. They might be those lonely, old people that have been forgotten that you mentioned earlier. So, you know, and one thing that I haven't mentioned yet, too, I'm sorry, is workers, outdoor workers are also extremely vulnerable to extreme heat. And so, and when it comes to indoor protections, like air conditioning subsidies or energy subsidies that allow people to pay for air conditioning, only 21 states have protections against hot water or excuse me, hot weather utility shutoffs. Only seven states have protections for outdoor workers, you know, mandated water breaks and other measures that are meant to keep people safe when the temperature is really high. And then to make matters worse, there's states like Texas. I don't know if you remember a couple years ago, it was called the Death Star Bill, where some cities, Houston among them, had tried to implement heat protections. And then Greg Abbott and Texas Republicans overrode that and actually passed a law that preempts local heat protections. So nothing can be more progressive than that, whatever the state of Texas is doing. And I think Kentucky recently followed suit and had a similar preemption bill. So what we clearly need right now are federal protections because leaving this up to the states means that anyone living in a GOP-controlled state is going to be at the mercy of right-wing lawmakers. And history shows that they're not going to willingly pass protections that would keep people safe. So we need a federal moratorium on utility shutoffs. We need much more funding for LIHEAP. It's already, even before the even before vote proposed zeroing the program out, it's already underfunded. I think only one in five qualifying households gets the money that they need. It's also, it's historically tended to be used more for home heating in the winter, which is another serious crisis that's all related to this. Winter Storm Uri in Texas a couple years ago kind of revealed some of these same issues. And not as much money is usually left over in the summer months. So we need way more resources. But I guess just to bring it back to your original question, as much as we need all these protections and funding for adaptation and cooling and other things, everything is going to continue to get worse if we don't stop increasing fossil fuel emissions. So that's sort of like the key preventive tool right there is to mitigate the climate crisis by expediting the clean energy transition and changing, you know, kind of reindustrializing in a green way. We need to change the way we do housing, transportation, energy, all sorts of things. I mean, going back to what you said about the states and states' rights and federal plans, did it feel like to you kind of during Trump 1? And I don't want to put this all on one individual because these are years in the making processes. But didn't it feel to you like a little bit during Trump term one that we were going to see states as almost kind of their own little fiefdoms, especially with Texas and abortion? Because that was a big issue, right? That really got the resistance Dems kind of up in quote-unquote fighting when that abortion ruling came down, when Roe v. Wade got overturned. I don't see the same sort of fervor in the fight when we talk about switching up from natural gas and things like fracking. Louisiana, Texas, North Dakota, I think they fracking Pepper. Pennsylvania as well. You know, these are places that have some serious environmental issues. Those are earthquakes in Pennsylvania now. But these are also industries that don't just employ people, but these are jobs that can be generational and lift people out of poverty. That seems to be the fight, convincing these people that the world will still turn and you won't lose all of your big screen TVs if we go a little greener. That's a really important point. And I think we need to be serious about, you know, I think the concept of just transition has been thrown around for a long time, but hasn't always been, or maybe never has been implemented well in practice. And so, you know, workers employed in polluting industries are skeptical of, you know, what are the chances that they will be made whole during this process of transition. And so this is where, you know, you'd like to see just a way more adequate level of planning and much more democratic economy because we're at the mercy of, you know, decisions that are being made in boardrooms by corporate executives. They're kind of calling, they are calling the shots. And if we had a more democratic economy and, you know, greater levels of participation and we could actually plan out a just green transition, I think there'd be more buy-in. You know, that's why I think that the Green New Deal offers a promising way forward because I think one of the key ideas of the plan is that this is in many ways an economic opportunity. It's a huge jobs program. So if we maybe talked more in the language of like a federal job guarantee, we're going to directly create jobs where people are basically building a new society, a much more egalitarian and environmentally sane society. Like there's a lot of work that needs to be done and a lot of people that are in need of good, high-paying union jobs. And so we need to kind of bring these two things together. I think there's just, there's a lot to be done. We should be retrofitting our cities to deal with the fact that, you know, even if we stopped emitting carbon and methane tomorrow, there is already such a high concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that to some extent, like some level of warming and therefore worse extreme weather is locked in. But as I mentioned before, you know, every degree that we can prevent matters. So like we have to do two things at once. We need to mitigate further damage, prevent further damage, and we also do need to make some adaptations so that we can live more safely with this climate-changed world that is already here and that will continue to change.

Our team of expert veterinarians ensure your furry friend gets the advanced treatment they deserve. With 24/7 emergency services, we're always ready for those unexpected moments. From cardiology to oncology, we offer comprehensive care tailored to your senior pets' needs. . So, yeah, I mean, is it the fight a lot harder? Because it's also we're not fighting just people that have AC, we're also fighting, in my opinion, just-in-time delivery, right? Like the ability to just get a bunch of bullshit that you really don't need, that you feel like you need so quickly all over the country, all over the world for that matter. Um, that oh, it's so hot and I don't have AC, but there's a portable fan on T-Moo, right? And it's made of plastic, it's gonna last for five days. Like, these are the things that we're addicted to, and I don't want to put it all on consumerism because that it's way too simple. Um, but I think that as a part of it, to open up to a bigger picture, to look at a Corporations and say, well, these are some of the problems. I feel like we're also so addicted to our things, our treats, as Matt Christman calls them, that we can't see beyond the treat, I feel like, to even think about how wonderful it would be to be able to take high-speed rail, for example, opposed to airplanes. There should be high-speed rail from Los Angeles to San Francisco. That doesn't seem like a crazy concept. I remember when the idea was rolled out in like 99, 2000, and here we are almost 30 years later, and the project has just been scrapped and nothing ever happened anyway. Why are we so terrified of progress when it would make our lives better? But we love progress when it makes the mundane banality of our life better. Like, oh, you know, I can go on Chad GPT and make some, some, I can make my son dance in a picture where he wasn't dancing already. Why, why, help me, help me out, Kenny. That's a really wonderful question. And yeah, you, you bring up a really big paradox because I think a lot of us are, you know, too many people are invested in, I think, what we would call a false sense of progress. You know, what you just said, AI or rapid delivery, when we're missing the bigger picture of, you know, what kind of society we live in if we prioritize, you know, people over profits and we pursued, you know, decommodified public goods. And yeah, I think that that would be much more preferable. So, you know, mass transit over, you know, individual automobility, which that was, you know, automobility was such a big aspect of the suburbanization of the United States, which is another, you know, sort of. We're talking almost 80 years. I know I'm older than you. If you told me that you're not 28, I'm going to walk to wherever you are and shake the hell out of you. You look young, and I know you are younger. But you're going back like 70 years. Why are we still looking at Asia as the Blade Runner world and we're living in the Flintstones land? Cars don't last. They're just right. Some obsolescence has been deliberately planned, I think, because the more rapid that industries can make the turnover time between when you need to consume item A and item B, the less time between those, the better for them. So there's planned obsolescence. And, you know, I think it's interesting the questions you posed, like, and you brought up the lack of high-speed rail in California. I guess I should just point out that I think there is a false narrative or a misleading narrative about the sources of our problems that's been gaining a lot of traction recently. And I'm referring to the so-called abundance agenda. And I'm not a fan because that's what's really going on, isn't it? I think it's, you know, rebranded neoliberalism because if you read what abundance advocates have to say, they are, they tend to blame every problem that we have on the government. They say that if only we deregulated whatever it is that they're talking about, because no matter the question, the answer is deregulation. If we deregulated this industry or this sector, then supposedly benevolent corporations would invest and provide whatever it is that we need, whether it's affordable housing, clean energy, mass transit. They have a naive belief that capital will come to the rescue. But, you know, corporations don't produce things just to produce things or provide things for people. They produce things to make money and profits. And so sometimes the profit maximization strategy is actually to restrain or constrain supply because then, you know, if they if they, and you saw this, this isn't a good example necessarily because it's not clean energy. But remember last year or two years ago, there was the big price fixing scandal where Scott Sheffield, I believe is his name, pioneer fracking CEO, was caught conspiring or colluding with other drillers in the U.S. and OPEC to reduce supply because they said then we can charge more for gas, we'll make more money. So, this idea that corporations are waiting around to produce an abundance of goods for all of us just doesn't really fit reality. And so I think that abundance misdiagnoses the sources of our problems, the causes of our problems, and then it also is unable to, it's incapable of solving the problems that it purports to solve. So usually, when you scratch beneath the surface of whatever problem it is that we're looking at, it's not that's the culprit, it's usually some form of plutocracy or oligarchy that's standing in the way. You know, I think that's really instead of, yeah, instead of looking to cut government red tape, and I'm using scare quotes because that's part of this neoliberal sort of technology of and talking anytime we're talking about cutting red tape or efficiency, those are usually those should be considered big flashing, you know, red warning signs that something bad is coming. In the introduction, we kind of touched on, or I kind of touched on homeless encampment. Tony Spencer here with AAA Heating and Cooling. If your living room feels like a wax museum in slow collapse, then your AC is trying to quit. We'll replace it with something that actually works before the candles melt on their own. Call AAA Heating and Cooling today. CCP number 222. Open-air drug markets, things that I feel, again, Gavin Newsome in California has used, and definitely Donald Trump is using in places like DC right now to demand for no nonsense, tough on crime responses. How does this bipartisan criminalization of poverty intersect with climate vulnerability? And to what degree can the deliberate withdrawal of federal support by both parties over decades be understood as a broader authoritarian governance style that treats the poor as disposable? Yeah, that's a great question. I think that when you see these just grotesque crackdowns on the homeless, it really drives home how cruel bipartisan neoliberalism has been. Because it's so obvious that criminalizing homelessness has nothing to do with solving the problem. At best, it might move the problem around, or there's no long-term solution that's being proposed. It's simply cruel. The way that we would solve the housing problem is to ensure that everyone has a job that pays a living wage and that we build an adequate number of affordable homes. But that would mean decommodified housing, not depending on market rate housing. That would just, it would kind of run counter to a lot of the policies that are dominant in our society, right? Because so much of what the U.S. has been about for nearly 100 years is building houses and filling them with things, suburbanism, homeownership. And, you know, this, I think this is a really big aspect of neoliberalism: you know, Colin Crouch calls it privatized Keynesianism because basically, you know, homeowners use real estate appreciation as a sort of piggy bank to fund their own health care or their children's higher education, their retirement. In other words, like for the privileged few, it's not just a few. It is a significant subset of our society, but not a majority, and it's also a diminishing number. But for those who are affluent enough to do this, it's like we're relying on. Individual households to take care of things that we should take care of collectively as a society. So healthcare, higher education, housing, all of these things have been turned into individual responsibilities instead of goals that we would get, you know, this idea that people are responsible for their own well-being is just, it is hegemonic. And it's also, I think, hopefully people are waking up to the fact that if we continue this way, you know, it leaves all of us worse off. Yeah, I mean, I'm agreeing with you. I'm not going to disagree with you, but I do think people still want to, I don't want to say have the American dream, excuse me, but I think they want to have the nest egg that is comfort, right? If you can't get a pension, if Social Security isn't going to give you enough money to be able to retire, then you at least want to be able to be a homeowner so you can have, like you said, your equity to hopefully fall back on. But even that can be a little bit of crap in one hand and hope in the other when we talk about how equity works, you know, with inflated housing markets that we saw in the late aughts, I guess, right before what we're going to call the financial crash and not the depression. You really saw places that were so overvalued that people just evacuated their homes and you got left with these ghost towns, right? But thinking of California and the central part of the state. And I read a statistic that said your generation is apparently buying houses even faster than my generation was at that point. I'm a younger Gen Xer, which I found kind of fascinating because I was like, oh, well, I guess people are doing a little bit. I need to stop watching the internet because it's lying to me. No one can afford anything. So I also think that's part of the problem that there is a bit of comfort. There is some generational comfort going on right now where the homelessness can just be blight. It's not a failure of society. It's just a series of individual failures. And it's blight that is lowering my property value and making me not want to go to the downtown eatery, but to the suburban eatery, thus causing gentrification in the downtown eatery as we move these people around. It's interesting because I think, you know, I agree with you that homeownership is, you know, ideologically, you know, really popular in the United States. But there is a massive trade-off because, in some ways, like, and I would say that it's a bad bargain that we've gotten as a society because people, you know, we've traded in a way like having a robust welfare state. Instead of that, we have, you know, a lot of individual homeowners who are trying to use that real estate appreciation to as a personal safety net. Ironically, this is something where the climate crisis could actually maybe change people's minds about this because I feel like we're not that far away from having potentially a mortgage crisis that's even more widespread than the foreclosure crisis of the right before the great financial crisis. Because due to these patterns of increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather, a lot of real estate in the United States is overvalued by trillions of dollars collectively. And you're starting to see some of the effects of this, like ripple markets through insurance, skyrocketing costs of insurance and coverage withdrawals, higher premiums and all that. Eventually, though, if some areas are deemed uninsurable, then pretty quickly those areas become unmortgageable. And then you'll see these local real estate market crashes. And that can cascade throughout the economy because, as we saw with the foreclosure crisis that was caused by predatory subprime lending, once there's a critical mass of foreclosures in an area, That's going to exert a lot of, it's going to wreak havoc on local budgets, and then we'll probably see more austerity. It's just a really bad spiral of problems. And so, yeah, I think I guess one of the takeaways is that we started talking about heat, but all of these problems are interconnected and frankly are going to require solutions that go far beyond our status quo. And so, you know, that's to get back to another sort of point that you and I have been making. I think we need to, even though I've been in the piece, you know, focused most of my ire on the Trump administration and congressional Republicans, like our analyses do need to go beyond Trump to look at the systemic sources of the problem, structural causes of these problems. And then the solutions are going to need to be very far-reaching. Like, we do need to think in terms of transformative visions. Like, we can't just tinker around the edges. You know, we're really going to need to pursue social and economic democracy. And yeah, I think, you know, one more thing that I didn't address earlier that you were talking about is just like we've, a lot of people are getting used to, oh, it's so convenient to have instant or 24-hour delivery. And then it occurred to me, you know, I think the photo that's on that article in Jackman is an Amazon delivery driver. So that's, those are some of the workers who are most vulnerable to extreme heat, our delivery drivers. Those UPS trucks, post office, FedEx, all of that, those trucks reach just unbearable temperatures. So, yeah, as a society, you know, if we're truly committed to solidarity, I would happily trade, you know, if I can't have my instant delivery of everything, if that means keeping my fellow working people safe, I'm all for that. So, I hope that that is how other people would approach that. I don't want to be naive. I know some people would take some more convincing, but I think like if the trade-off is, you know, if we're going to need to change the way we live and not be such a, you know, instant gratification consumerist society, you know, that's perfectly fine with me. Because as you were saying earlier, a lot of that quote-unquote progress is illusory anyway. It's not that important to have the thing that you ordered, you know, at your house the very next day, especially if that's endangering workers. Like, I don't want to contribute to that. I want, you know, deliver me the package when the temperature is safe. Or, sorry, real quick, I was thinking this is one of those cases where if we lived in a society where benefits were distributed, you know, equitably, this is one of those things where it's like, wow, this would be nice to have, you know, labor-saving technology that would actually keep people safe because this is some of the work that could be done by robots or drones or whatever. I'm not really advocating for that because in the society that we're in currently, I know that that would mean, you know, mass unemployment. But if we did live in a society where people were made whole, you know, we should all be working way less than we do, is the point. And we could redistribute work. Everyone could have a much shorter work week for better pay. And then for the dangerous, like toiling, it would be nice if, you know, that could be done and it would free up all of us would have more free time to enjoy our lives. I mean, it's funny because there was a movie that won an Oscar a few years back called Nomad Land, and it's based off of a book that is a true story where a journalist spent time in all these different industries that I think are depicted in the movie. And one of them was an Amazon warehouse. And when she talks about the Amazon warehouse, she talks about it in such a dark way that it sounds frightening. She talks about the ambulances that are at some of the Amazon warehouses in the middle of nowhere because they have an itinerant old workforce that just dies, just passes out, and they just have trucks ready to pick them up when they go down. I think if we knew what it looked like, maybe we'd care a little bit more. Maybe we'd care a little bit more. But, you know, even the culture industry. Takes these real industries when there was a time where you know Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle. We no longer write that. Now we write this romanticized version of the factory life that is freedom. When you watch that movie, gig work is freedom. You can eat breakfast on a country mountain and see the sunset and all the 20 million different colors in the sky. And it's like, man, you're making poverty look fucking gorgeous. And I think that's one of the problems that we make poverty look special and gorgeous. And there is an ugliness to it that maybe one has to understand if you want to begin to try to attempt to want to tackle it. We just want the blight gone. I don't know what city you're in and you don't have to say if you don't want to. Oh, no shit. Are you a Bronco fan? Yeah. No shit. Yes. Very cool. This is one of the first seasons in, I guess, 10 years that I'm looking forward to. Yes. Yes. I look forward to every season, Kenny, because I am a ridiculous Bronco fan that was around for the three Super Bowl losses. I was in elementary school when we won back-to-back in 97 and 98. Actually, don't you? My little brother was on, he played Little League football with uh Christian McCaffrey. Oh, no shit. Oh, damn. Yeah, I forgot the McCaffreys are from Denver because his dad was one of the best wide receivers of all time. I don't think he has to say about it. It's my show, my opinion. But I don't know if you feel the same way about that because even where you live in Denver, there's definitely massive homeless encampments in the downtown area as well. So it's this problem that people just don't want to look at. And when the temperatures change, be it severe heat, flooding, where you live, people literally freeze to death. It is a common occurrence in places like Colorado, the Dakotas, definitely Minnesota. If you live off the 90, someone's going to freeze to death. And it's just one of those things that I think no one really, really cares about. And when you hear about people dying in their own home, because a subsidy was cut that could have kept their power on, and the skyrocketing price of utilities. And it's almost like people just shrug their shoulders and go, okay, well, I'm going to go back to looking on T-Moon for some bullshit. Well, I think hopefully, maybe one way that I would encourage people to think about this differently is: well, first of all, if you know homelessness is becoming so much more widespread, it's clearly not the fault of any individuals failing. This is a societal failure. And the evidence for that is the fact that this is getting so much worse. Like, there's a reason why it's getting so much worse. Like, inequality is skyrocketing and has been for a long time. That's one of the clearest consequences of neoliberalization: just intensified inequality. And it's that combination of wage repression and austerity, like, and the destruction of the U.S. already had a relatively weak welfare state, but even the anti-welfare policies that have made things worse. So, if it's widespread, that's because it's a structural problem, not an individual failing. And then, I guess I would just encourage people, I know I'm preaching to the choir, but I guess for when we're talking to people who maybe disagree, I would encourage them to just think about the fact that they're one bad month away from being in that same situation. All of us are in a lot more precarious situation, I think, than we realize. You know, if somebody has in this country any kind of health issue, that can. That can cause bankruptcy. You could lose your house. If you become unemployed, that you're out on the street. So, all of us are just one, really, you know, shitty couple of weeks away from being homeless. And I think if we thought of it that way, we'd have more compassion and more solidarity. Because, yeah, I do, it is disturbing, like the vicious anti-homelessness or anti-homeless sentiment that we see. It is really depressing. And the people who, you know, are looking at people who are going through some of the worst days of their lives, and anyone looking at that person with contempt, it's just like, are you serious? It's a matter of luck that it's not. But I want to live in a society where those kind of, you know, life, quality of life is not determined by strokes of luck or bad luck. Like, we should have a guaranteed minimum standard of living that's humane and adequate. That's the goal. That's the goal, Brother Stancil. Look, in two weeks, we're having our NFL preview. Oh, yeah. Yes. It'll be heavy on Bo Nick's talk. Permie. Permie. And where can people? The article that we're talking about in question is in Jacobin. Wherever you are watching or listening to the show, there's a link in the description to Kenny's article. What are you working on next? So I guess I didn't mention this at the beginning. I'm a senior researcher at the Revolving Door Project. And your question about, you know, is it, should we limit our critique to Trump and the Republicans or broaden it to look at the bipartisan neoliberalism and the broader structural issue? It just so happens that I'm working on something that does that because I'm working on a similar piece, but it's more about Trump's homicidal hurricane policy. I don't know if you saw, but just, I think it was yesterday, 180 or so FEMA workers wrote an open letter that basically said that thanks to Trump's attacks on disaster preparedness and response, we're back to like pre-Katrina levels of readiness. And so like we're very vulnerable to a Katrina-level catastrophe. And you know, we started with this, it's the 30-year anniversary of that Chicago heat wave, 20-year anniversary of Katrina. And it's like we're almost in a worse position today than we were, which is hard to believe. And it's like Katrina made so explicit the consequences of neoliberalism. And rather than addressing those problems, we've retreated and backtracked. And there's been more rollbacks. So sorry, this is a really long answer to your question of what I'm working on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Something that we're really trying to do at the Revolving Door Project is focus on what I would call these foretold catastrophes. Like where, as I was saying at the beginning, we're not talking about natural disasters or acts of God. We're talking about, you know, man-made, socially produced catastrophes. And so we're trying to highlight how the Trump-Musk Doge vote, Russell vote, war on civil servants, on the federal workforce, on government programs is making all of us more vulnerable to disaster and unleashing completely preventable suffering and death. So, but the reason I brought up that piece is because I do try to stress at the end that we need to also consider the fact that part of the problem is that corporate Dems have refused to pursue a just alternative. And so that's why we're kind of stuck in the limbo where, yes, it's true that increasingly authoritarian Republicans are the biggest threat right now. But one of the reasons why we're stuck is because corporate Dems aren't offering that left populist alternative that people are eager for. So working on that, today actually we published a report called Debunking the Abundance Agenda. So we've been really critical of that for reasons that I was touching on earlier. So that's a couple more things that you could check out. Well, thank you very much, Kenny, for taking the time to talk with me today.
