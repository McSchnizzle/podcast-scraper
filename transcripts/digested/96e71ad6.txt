[00:00] Welcome back to the AI daily brief.
[00:02] Today we are digging into Andre
[00:05] Horowitz's just released top 100 Gen AI
[00:08] consumer apps. Now this is a study they
[00:11] do about every 6 months. They're on
[00:13] their fifth edition since 2023 and they
[00:16] use data from Similar Web and Sense
[00:18] Tower to get a sense of which Genai apps
[00:21] are getting the most traffic. So this is
[00:23] generally speaking not about revenue.
[00:25] It's about raw usage which has
[00:26] limitations in terms of a methodology.
[00:28] Of course, there are, I believe, some AI
[00:30] apps that have fewer users but much more
[00:32] usage from a revenue standpoint, but
[00:34] still, especially because they do this
[00:36] every 6 months, it creates a pretty good
[00:38] mechanism to see how things are
[00:40] changing. Now, before we get into this
[00:42] list, if you go back to 6 months ago in
[00:45] March of this year, there were a few
[00:47] things that were pretty notable from
[00:48] that particular list. The first was that
[00:50] we were still very much in the midst of
[00:53] the Deepsee moment. You'll remember back
[00:55] in January, Deepseek launched its app,
[00:58] which was for many people the first time
[01:00] that they had used a reasoning model,
[01:02] which blew a lot of minds. Yes, ChatBT
[01:05] already had 01, and 01 was at the time
[01:08] better than R1, at least based on a
[01:10] variety of different benchmarks, but 01
[01:12] was pretty buried behind paid accounts.
[01:14] I think at the time, in fact, it wasn't
[01:16] available at all in the free version of
[01:18] Chat GBT. And so when consumers had
[01:21] access to this reasoning model which
[01:23] inherently has some pretty huge
[01:24] advantages over what was available in
[01:26] the free chatbt and it had the fun
[01:28] revealed thought experience where people
[01:30] could actually see how the model was
[01:32] quote unquote thinking through the
[01:33] problem. It became a bit of a phenomenon
[01:36] and back then you could see this massive
[01:38] uptick where deepseek just raced ahead
[01:40] of claude perplexity and basically
[01:41] everything but chatgbt and even for a
[01:43] time ahead of the chat GBT app really
[01:46] making its mark on the industry. Another
[01:48] theme from 6 months ago was that AI
[01:50] video had recently reached a new level
[01:52] of proficiency, placing a bunch of
[01:54] companies on the list as well. The last
[01:56] trend worth noting from that previous
[01:57] edition was that we were just starting
[01:59] to see the vibe coding apps start to
[02:01] take hold. Cursor had just debuted on
[02:03] that list at number 41 in their web
[02:05] rankings. Bolt was at 48 and Lovable was
[02:08] on their brink list just outside the top
[02:10] 50. So that was the story in March. But
[02:12] what's the story now? We'll get into a
[02:14] bunch of their different conclusions,
[02:16] but I think by and large, what this list
[02:18] feels like to me is a bit of a settling.
[02:21] If you go back through the entire
[02:22] history of these charts, you can often
[02:25] find some really weird or surprising
[02:27] entries on the list. In other words,
[02:29] apps that you've never heard of somehow
[02:31] being in the top 50 either in web
[02:33] products or in mobile apps. Things feel
[02:35] like they're starting to settle down a
[02:37] little bit with leaders starting to get
[02:39] more comfortably into their leading
[02:40] role. You see, for example, a higher
[02:43] concentration of the core LLM apps at
[02:46] the top of both of the charts. The top
[02:48] four web products, for example, are Chat
[02:50] GPT, Gemini, Deepseek, and Grock in that
[02:53] order. Next is Character, but then it's
[02:55] Perplexity and Claude. Google has
[02:57] another entry, number 10 at Google AI
[02:59] Studio, and another at 13 with Notebook
[03:01] LM. And then in the top 25, you also
[03:03] have a number of the international LLMs
[03:05] like Duba, Kimmy, Quen 3. Again, kind of
[03:08] anchoring themselves there at the top of
[03:10] the list.
[03:11] But before I dig more into my analysis,
[03:13] let's see what A16Z thought was worth
[03:15] noting. First, and this won't surprise
[03:17] you given that I just mentioned a bunch
[03:18] of Google AI properties on that list.
[03:20] Their number one trend is Google making
[03:22] big moves. They write, "Google saw four
[03:24] entrance on the web list. For the first
[03:26] time, were able to rank their traffic
[03:27] and include them independently. Gemini
[03:30] was, as we just mentioned, second place
[03:32] behind Chat GBT, but Google AI Studio,
[03:34] Notebook LM, and Google Labs all made
[03:36] appearances on the list. Now, it is
[03:38] worth noting that although Gemini has
[03:40] risen up to number two behind chatbt,
[03:42] there is still an absolute chasm between
[03:44] the two. According to this data, Gemini
[03:47] gets about 12% of ChatBT's visits on the
[03:50] web. So, literally just a little over
[03:52] onetenth of the number one. It is just
[03:54] incredible how big ChatBT's first mover
[03:57] advantage was and the name recognition
[03:59] that has associated them with AI for so
[04:01] many people. Still, Google's ascendancy
[04:04] is really impressive, and the fact that
[04:05] they've got this diversity of products
[04:07] definitely matches the general sentiment
[04:08] that we see right now with Google
[04:10] resurging to a leadership role in the AI
[04:12] space overall. I was interested to see
[04:14] Notebook LM so high, especially given
[04:16] that a lot of the hype wave of that has
[04:17] faded from the end of last year. It
[04:19] certainly suggests that the people who
[04:21] are using it are finding it to be
[04:22] durably valuable, not just a one-off
[04:23] type of intrigue. But still maybe the
[04:25] most notable to me was that Google Labs,
[04:27] which is their experimental home for new
[04:29] models, actually made the list at number
[04:31] 39. Labs is where you can find things
[04:34] like Project Mariner, which is Google's
[04:35] agentic browser. But the real driver, it
[04:38] appears to be, is their dominant video
[04:39] model, V3. A6Z writes that Google Apps
[04:42] traffic spiked more than 13% following
[04:44] V3's launch back in May. I think that as
[04:47] V3 moves out into its own space, you're
[04:50] going to see that do nothing but rise.
[04:52] A16Z's next notable trend is that while
[04:55] Elon might be out there suing Apple and
[04:56] Open AAI for collusion, Grock is in fact
[04:59] making gains when it comes to its place
[05:01] relative to Chad GPT. Grock is now up to
[05:03] number four on the web and number 23 on
[05:05] mobile. And as A6Z writes, the company's
[05:08] jump on mobile has been particularly
[05:10] striking, going from a cold start with
[05:11] no app at the end of 2024 to upwards of
[05:14] 20 million monthly active users. Now,
[05:15] Grock's mobile usage really kicked up in
[05:17] July in the wake of the release of Gro
[05:19] 4, jumping up nearly 40%. That said, it
[05:23] looks like from the numbers that at
[05:24] least some meaningful part of that was
[05:26] not just the superior reasoning of Gro
[05:28] 4, but in fact the introduction of the
[05:30] AI companion avatars, which included not
[05:33] safe for work options. The number three
[05:36] trend that Andre identifies is about the
[05:38] rise of China. Now, the interesting
[05:40] thing that they explore is to what
[05:41] extent their placement on this list
[05:43] reflects the China market just being
[05:44] large and not having access to the
[05:46] Western models versus China actually
[05:48] infiltrating the Western models. They do
[05:51] know that number nine Quark which is
[05:52] Alibaba's AI assistant, number 12 Duba
[05:55] which is Bite Dance's LLM and number 17
[05:58] Kimmy all saw more than 75% of their
[06:00] traffic coming from China. However, they
[06:02] also noted that many entrance on this
[06:04] list are, as they put it, developed in
[06:06] China but now exported globally with the
[06:08] vast majority of their usage in other
[06:10] countries. They even pointed out that
[06:11] some of the so-called Chinese tools are
[06:13] blocked in China. They specifically note
[06:15] video models. Chinese video models in
[06:17] particular have tended to have an
[06:18] advantage over western developed models
[06:20] both because there are more researchers
[06:22] focused on video in China and there are
[06:24] fewer IP regulations with likely
[06:25] training on copyrighted data. V3 was the
[06:28] first US model to break this trend which
[06:30] is partially trained on YouTube data.
[06:32] Now maybe most interesting is that 22 of
[06:35] the 50 apps on the mobile charts were
[06:38] developed in China although only three
[06:41] of those 22 are primarily used in China.
[06:44] One of the big differences between web
[06:45] and mobile is that there's still in the
[06:47] mobile apps chart a huge concentration
[06:49] around discrete specific AI applications
[06:52] that interact with mobile native
[06:53] features like the camera. For example,
[06:55] me too all on its own had five entries
[06:57] on the list including their photo and
[06:58] video editor, beauty plus, beauty cam,
[07:00] wink, and airbrush. Next trend from
[07:03] A16Z, which is certainly one that stood
[07:04] out to me as well, is that if in the
[07:06] last edition we saw the early emergence
[07:08] of vibe coding, it has now come on as a
[07:10] full force. Bolt has actually fallen
[07:13] now. Remember, it had just snuck on the
[07:15] list at 48 before, but it is now on the
[07:17] brink list, just missing the cut. While
[07:19] both Lovable and Replet surged onto the
[07:22] main list, the top four Vive coding apps
[07:24] are now getting over 50 million monthly
[07:25] web visits all combined. Interestingly,
[07:28] A16Z also looked at data from credit
[07:30] card panel provider Consumer Edge and
[07:32] showed that vibe coding platforms are
[07:34] seeing much stronger revenue retention
[07:36] than some might have imagined. In other
[07:37] words, it appears that people aren't
[07:39] just trying these things out once and
[07:40] then abandoning them. In many cases, in
[07:42] fact, they're growing their monthly
[07:43] spend in the several months following
[07:45] their first usage. As the platforms get
[07:47] more mature and people are building more
[07:49] sophisticated things, you're also seeing
[07:51] a division between web visits that are
[07:53] going to the core application versus web
[07:56] visits that are going to sites where
[07:58] things built on those apps are housed.
[08:00] In other words, both lovable and replet
[08:02] have their primary URLs, lovable.dev and
[08:05] replet.com, where people go to sign in
[08:07] to actually use the vibe coding tools.
[08:09] But then if they publish an application
[08:11] that's going to live on lovable.app or
[08:13] replet.app, unless of course they use
[08:14] their own domain, both lovable.app and
[08:16] replet.app are starting to see some
[08:18] meaningful traffic. Replet.app
[08:20] applications are somewhere around 2 to 3
[08:22] million monthly visitors and lovable.app
[08:24] creations are up over 10 million.
[08:26] Overall, Lovable is 23 on the web list
[08:28] and Replet is 41. It will surprise you
[08:31] not at all to learn that I think that
[08:32] this is going to be an area that just
[08:33] continues to see massive growth. I would
[08:35] be shocked if either Lovable or Replet
[08:37] aren't in the top 20 6 months from now,
[08:39] the next time A16Z looks at this. The
[08:42] last note going with this theme of
[08:43] stabilization is that Andre identifies
[08:45] that there are 14 companies now who have
[08:48] appeared every time on all five
[08:50] iterations of their web top 50. They
[08:53] write these companies represent a true
[08:55] cross-section of consumer behavior with
[08:57] AI. General assistance like Chat GBT,
[08:59] Perplexity, and Poe. companionship like
[09:01] character AI, image generation with
[09:04] midjourney and Leonardo, image and video
[09:06] editing with feed and cutout, voice
[09:08] generation with 11 Labs, productivity
[09:10] tools with photo room, gamma and
[09:12] Quillbot, and model hosting with CVI and
[09:14] hugging face. Overall, like I said, it
[09:17] feels to me like we're starting to see a
[09:19] settling in these lists. There still is
[09:21] a little bit more noise and chaos, I
[09:23] think, in the mobile apps, which makes
[09:24] sense given how much discovery happens
[09:26] just based on app stores, but especially
[09:28] when you look at the web list, you're
[09:30] really starting to see what you would
[09:32] imagine to be the core themes start to
[09:34] emerge and really assert themselves.
[09:36] General purpose LLMs are near the top.
[09:38] Vibe coding tools are on the rise.
[09:40] Companionship apps continue to make an
[09:41] appearance. Mediabased productivity
[09:44] tools continue to be strong. And if
[09:46] there is one thing that I think is worth
[09:47] putting a finger on to watch for the
[09:49] future, it's the entry at number 31 of
[09:51] Manis. As far as I can tell looking over
[09:54] this list, Manist is the only pure play
[09:56] general agent platform on the list. Now,
[09:58] we've talked a lot on this show about to
[10:00] what extent agents are going to come
[10:02] online in a general form versus a very
[10:04] specific or vertical form. The fact that
[10:06] Manis is all the way up there at 31
[10:08] suggests that there might be room or at
[10:10] least interest in a general purpose
[10:12] agent and even outside of the core
[10:14] foundation model companies. So when we
[10:16] come back in 6 months, that is one that
[10:18] I think will be worth checking back in
[10:19] on. Will Manis be higher? Will there be
[10:21] other general purpose agents on the
[10:22] list? Will Google have moved, for
[10:24] example, Project Mariner out of labs
[10:26] into its own space? All questions for
[10:28] the future. But for now, that is going
[10:30] to do it for today's AI daily brief.
[10:32] Appreciate you listening or watching as
[10:33] always. And until next time, peace.
