I know you're used to seeing our normal Saturday free show, but because our guest is coming from a different country, this is the only day and time that worked. And you guys love giving me guff about never talking about soccer or, as we should refer to it today, football. So here you go. The first ever TIR football Saturday. If you're new to the channel, thank you so much for taking the time to check us out. If you are a returning listener, subscriber, or very valued patron. Hell yeah. Thank you for your patience. We were on some serious rockstar time. This was like Guns N' Roses. Lauren Hill time. In light of the latest crisis papers, I decided to have a special Sunday movie night. We're going to watch the original Mad Max. Also, the latest issue of the Crisis papers is up. Wherever you're watching or listening to this show, there's a link in the description so you can check that out. Living in the Bronson Age, New American Fascism, where I mention in detail Mad Max, as well as some other films I'd love to watch with you guys. And maybe if we do it early enough, we can have a kind of crisis papers-themed double feature to watch some of these dystopian films that were mentioned in that. If you appreciate the programming and want to be a part of our movie nights and more, become a patron for as little as $3 a month or $30 for the year. You can have access to champagne rooms past and present. Join us for our movie night watch parties and just enjoy the fun. Now, let's get to why you people are here in the first place. Soccer Saturday or Football Saturday. When a Spanish soccer analyst on YouTube began breaking down Uruguayan football matches, he didn't expect to stumble into a hornet's nest of corruption, mismanagement, exploitation, and media collusion. But instead of just commenting, Yossima, our guest today, mobilized through his channel. I'm going to. Mess this up, Yosima, so don't get mad at me. La La Cora de Dielsa. He gave fans democratic structures to hold club leaders accountable, empowered workers inside the system to expose wrongdoing, and offered exiled journalists, some of whom faced death threats, a new platform. His investigations have revealed the shadowy networks linking soccer agents, media moguls, and rent seekers draining the lifeblood of Uruguayan football. Today we'll hear from Yossima himself about how one YouTuber became a movement and what it means to take on corruption in the world's most beloved sport. Please welcome coming all the way live from a secret bunker somewhere in the world. I'm not going to tell you where. Please welcome Yosima. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for having me, Jason. And I have to say, first of all, I don't find myself in that description, but let's figure something. The thing here is there's a massive part of this, which is the community. I'm just a normal guy, a common person, but I found some people over there in Uruguay that they were deserving more than what we used to get from the journalists, from the politicians, from all the football world all over Uruguay. And there was a spot, and I tried to do my best to give them football, to give them information, and to speak about democracy, about the people, about the workers, and about all the things that I've been learning in my whole life. So, thank you. Thank you for having me. No, thank you for doing this. One of the things we talk about on this show is how regular people do extraordinary things all of the time. And we should never limit ourselves or downplay our ability to do things. You started as a soccer analyst on YouTube. What first drew you? You're from Uruguay. No, no. Where are you from? I'm from Spain. Okay. Spaniard. I hate that word. Let me say. I don't like that word Spaniard, but I am an Hispaniard. And I started in YouTube because I used to have a podcast here in Spain. And it was 2022. There was the World Cup in Qatar. And I thought, well, let's make a YouTube channel and let's analyze football, what I call football. And let's do it with the countries, with the countries that speak Spanish mainly. So I did my national team, the Spanish national team, Argentina, I think Peru, and Uruguay. And the Uruguay video was amazing. There's like thousands of people just watching that video and enjoying it and asking for more. And in that moment, I thought maybe, maybe that's my aim. Maybe that's the place for me in YouTube. It's so, so hard to find people that wants to hear you, that wants to know something about you, and who cares about what you say. And at that moment, Uruguay just spent three matches in that World Cup. They were doing so bad at that tournament. And the channel was called La Locura de Bielsa. Bielsa is an Argentinian manager. And I don't know how to explain this, but a couple of months after the World Cup, Bielsa was hired by the Uruguayan national team. So then all the people started asking me to keep on the continuity of following the national team of Uruguay. And that was the day that my life changed because I've started to speak about football, to analyze what Bielsa does, what Bielsa thinks, what Bielsa watch football for Bielsa and all that stuff. And then I started to learn what is Uruguay, what is the country, how's the people, what was going on over there. And I found, Jason, the country that is built from, I think, working people, regular people, something like you or me, common guys, but there's a mafia on top of that. There's some kind of black company which is so, so, so bad for the whole country, for the whole football thing. And they are just making so much money every year, every month, every day, every second. And the Uruguayan football is, I think, year in, year out, the poorest football in South America. And it doesn't have to be like that. So this reality for me was hard to understand because I found people that knows everything, knows what's going on, who are the bad people, and what do they have to do to kick them out. But they never move on. So I think, well, let's do something about it. That's it. When did you first realize something was really wrong in the Uruguayan soccer? I think the first time I saw that something was bad, but bad, I mean, so bad, was one day that there's a journalist that stole one of my videos. Whoa. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He just took everything. They put the video in the channel, they put all the advertising on top and stuff. And they didn't reach out, they didn't say anything. And I was streaming on that day, and they told me on the chat, hey, there's a guy here who stole your content. And I was thinking, Wow, this is for me to stole a video, it's like to go into a house and stole something. It's exactly the same. So I didn't realize how much it was gonna get heated, I think. But I got me on the not in this room, but on the room, and I started the video. And I say, I told him everything I think about these old journalists and how they act, how they think, how they live. And that video was popping over Uduwe. And that video reached some people that was struggling at that moment because they were suffering because they want to quit them from the jobs. And they write me and they told me the truth, let's say, about how it is all working, how the people is taking money from everywhere. And in that day, I thought, well, this is going to be harder than I thought. But if I started something, I have to finish it. So that was the day. Was there a specific moment or match or incident that made you say this isn't just bad management? This is systemic corruption? Well, it's hard to explain it. I'm going to try to do my best. Like I said, brother, take your time. The thing is, for me, I am Spaniard, and it's hard to understand how this can be like this. Okay, so for me to put it in English is going to be even harder. But the thing is, there's a broadcasting company called Tenfil, and this broadcasting company is at this moment owning all the rights from the Uruguayan league. And they pay just a few million dollars, just I don't know, 12 million, 11 million. This is valuated right now in about 40, 50 million dollars. So they are taking away like 40 million per year. Okay. And they are being here from 98. Okay, 98. There's like 25 years of this company on charge of everything. They don't own just the TV rights. They own everything, everything. The stadium's name, the The brand of the ball, the brand of the league, all the these boards around the pitch, they own absolutely everything and they don't pay for it. They just pay for the rights. Yeah, monopolio, monopolio. Okay. Yeah. And the thing for me right there is there's if you don't pay the price that something have to have to receive, the thing is the clubs they are not receiving the money that you should get. So they are poor right now. And as they are poor, they need money. So they go to this broadcasting company called Tenfield and they ask them for more money just to like a loan. Okay. So they loan them money. But the only condition is when this contract expires, you have to vote me. Even if I pay less, you have to vote me because you own me money. And I don't want that money back. That money is for you. Okay. You only have to do what I told you to do. That's the thing. And from 98 to today, today, they are being bossing everyone in the country, but not just in football, in country. Okay, they menace people. They are like a proper mafia. They've got guns. Really? Yeah, that's the thing. This is hard to understand, but that's the main thing here. They are a proper mafia. And they don't have anything else. So they are not in other countries. They are not in Brazil, in Argentine, and any other place. They are just there in Uruguay. And they are controlling everything, not just the TV rights, even the players. The players are for them also. They sell the players, they control everything in the clubs. So everything is from them. And the people, the regular people, the working class, as always, they have been told from years, this is what it is. That's it. There's no more. We are poor. We can complain. They are here. They are like giving away money. They are losing money. They are not. They are making a good profit here. They are not wasting money at all. But they, they've got all the journalists, they pay, pay, let's say, legal and legal, but they pay all the journalists and they say, okay, this is completely fine. Tenfil is like in the old days that God, like he was giving all the all the profit and all the vendions and all the things, like just like the spring God. But they are not. And the thing is, the common people are now awakened, have been investigating a lot, but a lot. I've been spending hours and day by day, month after month, and have been putting out some real documentation, some good documents, some proper things that have been. I don't know if how much people, but I think that there's been a part of a big change right now in Uruguay. And the common people are saying, it's fair. It's enough. Enough is enough. We have to change this. We have to get our football back, our clubs back. In Uruguay, it's not like, for example, in the Premier League. In the Premier League, the clubs belong to someone. That someone can be anyone. In Uruguay, the big clubs are not from someone, members' clubs. And they've got thousands of members who vote the president and all the stuff. So there's democracy in the base, and they have to keep that democracy running up. And they've got to protect it because democracy dies if you don't protect it, if you don't practice it. And that's the thing. It's hard to understand it, it's hard to explain it, but it's how it is. Many people just criticize online. You went further and actually organized fans into assemblies. How did that process begin? And what has it revealed about the relationship that you're speaking about between clubs and their supporters? Well, what I've Find out, Jason, is that in Uruguay, as the clubs belongs to the members, they've got power. They can change things. They can go to an assembly and vote for something. They can do it. But they didn't know that. They thought that it is what it is, and that's it. And there's a few persons that, well, they knew about this, but most of them were thinking, well, we can't do it. We don't have the platform. The media is not putting us in radio, in the TV. We can't do it. So my job here, Jason, was to give them the space. I call them pajaritos, which means little birds. I've got little birds everywhere in Uruguay. I've got thousands of little birds. And my little birds was telling me everything which is happening here, there. And with that, I can make the whole map. I can know what is actually going on. And some of them birds were inside the clubs. So I told them we need to act. There's a time in life for words. And words are important, but acts are more important than the words. So there's an example in a club which is called Montevideo Wanderers. And they've got a president. He's still there. And the president owned, how to explain it. That president asked Tenfil for money. So Tenfil gave them money. And that president now is under the control of the broadcasting company, Tenfil. But he didn't tell it, so the people didn't know about this loan of money. And we put some people on the assembly and we forced him to call to a general members' assembly, which he didn't want to do it because he just wants to do what Tenfil wants him to do. That's it. But we make a good campaign. We told people you have to go to the assembly. If you are a member, go there, protect your club, and tell the president what he has to do. Because president doesn't mean owner. He doesn't own the club, not at all. He's a part of the club. He's a worker. He's not a worker, but you understand what I'm saying. Yes. And so those members have to go there and told the president exactly what he has to do. It was hard to convince them because, I mean, as I told you, Tenfil, yeah, it's a mafia, the difficulty, it's hard to do it. But they did it and they went there and they told him, this guy is called Parcala. They told him, no, not anymore. In office, no, my friend, you have to do what we told you to do. And if you don't want, you better go out. And from that day, he is obligated to do what the members want. And that's a huge victory for us, a huge victory. And that shows up that if you say and if you explain and you show some documents and you prove that what you are saying is truth, people are gonna follow you because you don't have that much of truth in journalists right now. But you have to use that power to make good, to do something which is positive for the people. And we did it, and that's the main case. There's a lot of more, and a few of them are in the shadows. But I think that our job is to change things by empower people, and that's important for me. Have you faced threats since you started doing this? Yeah, I've been. I've been, but the thing is, as I'm not in Uruguay, it's not the same that to be walking on the streets. I mean, I've got a little advantage there, but they have been trying to counsel me every time. I own the biggest full. Channel in the country. Okay. Whoa. If you, yeah, if you go there, you see that there's 70,000 subscribers, which is not a lot if you compare it to Spain or the United States or something. But let's put in the table that there's just three million of Uruguayans all over the world. So 70,000 people is a lot. I've got more people there than all the proper media, than all the radios, than everything. Okay. And I ain't got any advertising. So they cancel everything. But really? Yeah, I don't have any, like any, any, any at all. Just, I mean, you can think that our space is not something important, but I think it is. I think it is. And I go into YouTube and I search for smaller channels and they got all the advertising of the world. And we don't. We don't. But what I do have is a proper community. And I don't need the advertising thing because I've got a community which holds the whole channel. And that's what they want to cancel. They took me into YouTube Justice a few months ago. They couldn't. They couldn't pop us out. And well, then there's people who write you up and tell you, I know where you live. I'm going to kill you. Blah, blah, blah. A couple of months ago, there's someone who wrote me there and he told me, I'm going to kill your sister. Whoa. I ain't got sister, so okay, fine. The make-believe sister, you can have her. I mean, I guess it can be scary. Who is your team? You said you were from Spain. Who is your Spanish team? Real Madrid. Real Madrid. Okay. That's my thing. Would you rather talk about Real Madrid and not have people threaten you, or would you get more threats if you talked about Real Madrid? Yeah, I think I will be getting more, but I am not a common fan of Real Madrid. I don't mess out too much with my club because I don't. I mean, I support Real Madrid since I was a kid, since I was a little baby. My whole family supports Real Madrid. I was born like a couple kilometers away from Santiago Bernabego. So, I mean, that's my club. But I am not so sure that Real Madrid is going in the proper way. For example, there's something that people, common people all over the world, doesn't know, but Real Madrid changed the colors on the shield. And in the proper shield of Real Madrid, there's a kind of how to say that purple. It's not purple, but let's say purple. If you go and buy a Real Madrid shield, you're going to find a strip blue, but that's not the color of my club. The color of my club is purple, not blue. And they remove it because of the that purple was because of the Spanish Republican flag, which is red, yellow, and purple. And that was the stripe on the Real Madrid shield, which is, you can find it everywhere until the 90s. It was there. But then one day it appears a blue stripe there. Nobody knows what it is doing there, but it is still there. And well, I support Real Madrid, but I don't support how they do things. Are they also kind of a corrupt franchise? Yeah, yeah, of course. Of course. There's not, I mean, not the owner, because again, Real Madrid doesn't belong to someone. It's a members club. It is weird. It is weird, but it is a member club. But the president, the Real Madrid president is Florentino Perez. He owns one of the biggest construction company all over the world, which is called ACS. And he must be the most corrupt people all over the planet for sure. Podbean, your message amplified. Ready to share your message with the world? Start your podcast journey with Podbean. Podbean.

You've mentioned a soccer agent turned media mogul and rent sinker. What makes this figure such a central problem in Uruguayan football? Well, the thing is, if you are regular people, Jason, and you love football, you support your club, you watch the games, you think that some of the things that happen right now in Uruguay, they are acceptable and they are not. That's the thing. They put, like, for example, I'm going to give you just a little example to then redirect you. If you put a football match in Uruguay, in any club, you're going to find that there's advertising everywhere, not just on the size of the pitch. There's advertising on the script, even during the match. You can watch football. There's just a banner over there with betting things, with alcohol stuff, with everything, what you shouldn't do, all that is in that advertising. And then the commentator is not commentating the match, he's telling you to drink alcohol, to go and bet something on the match, which is not happening in the Premier League, in the Spanish League, in anything. And they think that this is normal and this is not. And that guy that tells you what is going on at the match is then, when the match is end, is the one who tells you what was happening in that match. And the day after, 8 in the clock, okay, he, the same person, is going to tell you exactly the same thing. And that's why they don't realize that they are all lying because all the things that they say, they don't think about it. This is not something that they believe. It's just something that they have to do because they earn money on doing that. That's the thing. So the whole stuff is corrupt, the whole thing. And when you say something about that, they just, I mean, when I say yet and they, I'm speaking about the journalists, the companies, the broadcasting, and all the stuff. They try to cancel you. They try to tell you that I've got an agenda. Me, I've got an agenda. I am the one who's got an agenda. So I can't speak about Uruguayan football because I am not Uruguayan. I am Spanish and that's the thing. But then if you say that, the people is just realizing about all this. And in the last eight months, seven months, the channel has been growing a lot based on this. Because if you say something that it is truth, but they didn't realize, when they realized there's no way back, there's no way back at all on that. And for me, the big problem at this moment in Uruguay is to kick out Tenfil. However, is the cost, no matter what, they have to kick them out. But there's something that I've been putting on the table from day one: the next broadcasting company that goes to Uruguay is going to be even worse, even worse. It's the same. They are the same kind of people trying to make the same amount of money. They don't care about people, they don't care about clubs, they don't care about social stuff. They just think about money. That's it. So it's not enough to kick Tenfil out. They've got to kick Tenfil out, but they've got to learn this. That's the main thing for me. But I don't have any hope at this moment. Oh, I'm afraid to say, yeah. Well, let me ask you, uno grande problema in estaros ninosportes, todo desportes, is gambling. Gambling apps. At Astound Business Solutions, we know every business is unique. That's why we create tailored solutions to help you. Grow with the nation's leading business internet and 24/7 support. We're always here if you need us. Your business is our business. We are astounded for a reason. Right. Is it a problem also with football? Because you're talking about gambling apps as well. Is that a problem as well, too? Yeah, it is a big problem. I'm going to tell you something that my community knows about this because my main thing is to be transparent with my community. Everything that what's going on, I tell them. If I do something right, I told them. If I do something wrong, I told them. That's the thing for me, okay? Because I need them to trust me. Since I've been, I don't know, three years more or less in the Uruguayan football. Since a couple of years ago, I've been receiving every week almost an offer from a gambling company to put some advertising on the channel. At the beginning, it was just like, well, we give you $50, something like that. They offer me three or four months ago, they offered me per month $4,000. Whoa! Per month. To advertise, to say, hey, when you want to put the bet up, use blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Whoa. Hey, you are better. That was not it. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. There's more. They gave me uh, like an offer which was a code. Um, if one of my one of the community guys put that code in the resistor pan of the of the bed website, if that person uh lose any kind of money from now to the end of time, okay, I'm gonna receive um five percent, ten percent, I don't know such exactly how much, yeah, commission for life, for life. I don't have to do any stuff on the channel, just for life. So, they think I can be um just here at home with my wife, yeah, cheering, chilling out, everything is fine, and I'm gonna feed my kids of the money that someone is losing. That's crazy, that's crazy. So, um, what I did was uh put the camera on and put a video and say, I'm I ain't going to do it no matter what. I don't want money, I don't need money, I don't need that money. If someone can give me money to do something which is positive, which I like to do it, it's fine, money is not a problem, but I don't want to have this kind of stuff on my channel because I don't want people to lose money to get in trouble with all this. This is a complicated world, the camera worlds are a complicated world, and and they've got just so much money and they are everywhere. You can't put a football match without knowing that there's some kind of gambling. But the thing in in Uruguay, Jason, and that's why they put so much money in that case on my channel, is because in Uruguay, there's a monopoly of of the gambling stuff which is which belongs to the to the government you can't put a gambling how how can you say that there's a place when you go and you put your beta like a store or shop or something like that you can't do it there's a a company that governments owns that company which is called super something and that's it that's it so the government is making money on gambling also that's so complicated so they they need to go in uruguay they can't put that much money on uruguay because the the law doesn't give you that space so i am the right guy for them because i don't live in uruguay i don't pay taxes in uruguay i am not under the law of uruguay of course and i've got the bigger channels on the on the country so they they can do they can put a big offers on the on the table but i don't i don't want to do that i i know that there's people which lost almost everything which is even a And an illness, the gambling stuff. And I don't want to make money on the on older people's trouble. No, I don't. I don't. In estos unos decimos, uh, sell out. Sell out. What is your word? Yeah, it's like well, sorry, como muy bienecho awacio como. So, no se. Same. I did a show recently, and I've written a lot about it because I didn't tell you before we started. You don't know anything about me, but I did music for years and I did like heavy, you can tell with the introduction music, heavy music, metal punk. But there's kind of an ethos that you don't sell out, right? You have to stay true to your morals and your values. I'm also older, and there was something to be said about having morals and values. I don't know if those things exist the same way they did 40 years ago, 30 years ago, even 20 years ago. And for you to say, and this is where it gets crazy, I don't know what commercials play on my channel because I don't get to pick them. So there could be commercials playing that I probably don't agree with. I've been told there's commercials for political figures. This is mainly a political show that I don't agree with that are not aligned with what we say. Right? I don't have a choice in that matter. And that's not my today. That's not my fight. But what you're talking about isn't forced advertisements on your channel. You're talking about actually getting contacted by a company, which is a lot of people's dream. Let's be honest with this space that we exist in in streaming, I don't make a lot of money from YouTube, right? I'm sure the same is for you. With 70,000 with 100,000, you're not making as much money as people think you make. But what you want is a placed advertisement because the pay is different. Someone is paying you a monthly amount to say what they'll give you a script, they'll show you exactly how to integrate it into your show, and it's easy money. And you get a commission. So when you hear Magic Spoon, and we talked the other day, BetterHelp, like Psychiatry, online psychiatry apps, which have been known to be harmful to people. And there's people selling it, lying. I use BetterHelp all the time because they think it's not a big deal and it's a good amount of money. If you would have advertised for the gambling app, you would probably make so much more money. You could invest that money and move out of your house, get a studio, get more help, get an editor, have slicker videos. And you said no. That's integrity. For me, I'm going to start with the beginning of your question. I think that there's a new kind of person right now. 40 years ago, 30 years ago, there was no internet, there was no other stuff. And right now, life has been changing a lot from the, I don't know, in the last 10 years, this is crazy. This is changing every time. And for me, we as a society, we can't lose our point. We can't lose what we have to do, what we think, what we live, just because of money. My point of view about money is if you do something for money, money is gonna own you at some point. But if you do something because you love that, because you dream about that question, whatever it is, at the end of the day, you're gonna get money because you're gonna be so good at it. And you're gonna get, I don't know how much, but you're gonna get money. You for sure, you're gonna get money. And in that case, I didn't even think about it because I've got a strong background, and my whole family won't let me get into that way because it's bad. It's a bad decision. It's easy money, so it's a bad decision. And from that day, I put that video online. The people can find it on my YouTube channel because I thought that this is the end because I told them and the whole community that I won't do it no matter what, no matter how much money. But they still write me, they still send me emails, they still insist because they think at some point this guy is going to lose the mind. At some point, he's going to say, Yeah, and I don't care about anything. Give me the money, and that's it. And as you said, I could be hiring a professional editor, or I could be moving into a new house, or I don't know, making some stuff. But I don't need it. Television. Tony Spencer here with AAA heating and cooling. The heat is here, and you're doing your best to cool off, dragging that sad, inflatable pool out from the garage. You know, the moldy one slowly leaking onto your lawn while the kids scream. Yeah, it's a vibe. If your actual AC system is acting like an inflatable pool leaking and barely holding on, maybe it's time to give us a call. We'll help you stay cool without the tarp or the panic. What's interesting to me, and we'll move on from this. What's interesting to me, and I don't know why it's even making me somewhat emotional, is we are in a moment where selling out is just so acceptable, especially in Estados Niños. I can't speak for where you're from, and I won't speak for where you're from. I don't know your background, I don't know if you have people that help you as far as even if that's the case. The point is that you're still doing it, you're still getting threats, you're talking to a people that are so small, right? You're talking about a country when I decided to do this show. I decided to do the show because I thought the story was interesting. I didn't do the show because I thought, oh, I'm going to get all these Uruguayan viewers, right? Look, if you want to keep watching what I do, because you can now, there's a new thing on YouTube where it translates for you, right? It translates speaking English, it'll translate for you in Spanish. You know, please keep watching the show. Yell at me in Spanish, help me learn the language better. But my point is to be offered the bag, we call it the bag. La bulza. It's all about la bolsa. Yeah. They handed you the bag, and you were like, I can't take it. Yeah. I can't take it. I don't want to take it. I don't want to take it because if I take it, now it owns me. I don't own it. It owns me. And I can't talk to the screen the same way if I take the bag. I'm lying to the people. I'm lying to the people. So, that for me is a big deal. And I think people like you need to be commended because it's so acceptable to take the bag. And that's the main goal from, I don't know how much people, but that's the main goal. In my country, it's the same. In my city, it's the same. In my hood, it's exactly the same. They owe all the money because money is what is all about. Money is going to give you the car that you dream. Money is going to give you the friends that you think you want. But there's just kind of a mental thing behind that. And for me, my whole dream is to spend just a few hours with my wife, sharing some coffee, speaking about life. That's my dream. And money doesn't give me that thing. I own that thing because we deserve this. And the thing right now is people just curse about money, about how much followers you've got on social media. Media and how much people you've got on, I don't know, Instagram, TikTok, who knows? I don't care about that. I really don't care. I don't give a about that because money is not about a website. Life is not about a website. Money and life are about what you can do for your people, for your society, and for your family. And money will come. Money will come. I don't need money from my family, from my thing, because I've got my little company and I've got my little job over there. And I do my job. And then when I'm free, I came here, I record a video, I go live streaming, and I try to help people. But for me, this is not about money. This is about regular people. This is about democracy. This is about values. And this is about what you, which is the thing that you're going to say to your children that you did in your life. And well, I've been doing this, Jason, because I think that when I don't have children right now, but when I will, I will tell them, well, I try to do my best to help people, and I didn't get anything that was not deserved. And Bielsa, the channel is called La Lucuda de Bielsa. Bielsa is a manager who's famous because he is a good manager, but also because of the philosophy of it's not about what you get, it's about what you deserve. And well, that's the thing. We have a super chat here. I want to read this to you. This guy started a revolution in my country. I always felt him to be transparent, honest, and a super hardworking guy. We'll keep supporting and sharing his work. Our football will always be grateful. Pablo is a great guy. He's a great guy. He's one of the, I don't know, first thousand subscribers of my channel. He's a great guy. Well, it's so happy to see him here. Well, this is another good comment. Cannot be controlled by greed or fear. That is truly dangerous. Yeah. That's what's scary when you don't think again. La Bolsa. That's the thing. Let me tell you something, Jason. I've been having big troubles with journalists in Uruguay. They've been saying, but not just about writing something. No, no, no, no. Live show on TV, on radio, that they're going to come to search me, to kill me, to fight me. This has been happening in the last 12 or 20 months. And I think that that comment is exactly what is going on. This is not about me. This is about the community. This is about the people who are following La La Cura de Vielsa. I'm not important. I'm just a common guy. I've got my family, my thing, and that's it. I'm not a rock star. I'm not Mickey Mouse. I'm not. No, no, I'm just a common guy. But the people who is following La La Cura de Vielsa, they've got the information of what is actually going on. They've got all the documents that I've got, which is a lot of documentation, and they know the good people in here. There's not any good people at all in any company and in every part of the Uruguayan football. And that's dangerous. That's dangerous. We have another super chat. Yoseme astoro lo que estabien. Gracias gustavo. But your program is about the people. Tu programa es sobre la gente. La gente es tienen power. They have the power when it comes to your show, which is which is really interesting and again powerful. And I think that's the reason why people are watching this show in English. The thing here is, I don't have any moderator or any people in the chat who is in charge of kicking people out or something. I don't have that. I won't have that. People can come to my channel and have their say because they are entitled to have an opinion about me and about everything. If you don't like, if they don't like me, as long as they don't use some kind of words, some saying, we can speak about it. There's no problem about that. This is democracy. You can say whatever you think. And I think that that's the power of the channel. Sometimes we make some kind of voting stuff or to have a decision to, let's say, if we invite someone or not, if you do something or we don't do it. And but yeah, this is all about the community. Kind of back to the original question. The mainstream media in Uruguay help the corrupt system. What risks have independent journalists faced in trying to tell the truth about what's going on there? I mean, I think Uruguay in that sense is sadly like to look to the past. They are like 10 or 15 years on the past about everything, about broadcasting, about communication, about journalism. You hear some kind of comments on those shows that you don't hear anywhere all over the world that belongs to the past. Like, for example, there's a couple of years, no, a couple of years, no, a couple of weeks ago, there's one of the most famous Uruguayan journalists who invite to the set a waiter, a girl. And he was just treating her like an object, not like a person. Just like in the old days, you know what I mean? And they don't realize that this is bad. You can't do that on a show. You can't treat person like objects on a show just because they are girls. We are speaking about a person that maybe is 70 years old or 80 years old. I don't know, but I don't care. And right now, there's a movement on this. And I think they're going to have to change. They are changing right now because people is really putting them in some troubles on the chat, on the streets, on everywhere. And they have to change. They have to move on. They have to be, I don't want to say good persons, but they have to figure that they are. They aren't, that's for sure. But they have to do some things and to try to tell people what they are not. And right now, I think that we've got an opportunity to change things, to make a new way of communicating. And I'm not inventing anything, anything that this is so common all over the world, but we have to change this on another way. I forget about the make question, but that's what I do also. I start to speak and then bibbing and I finish. And at some point. You told me beforehand, you said, hey, I might go for a long time. I was like, yeah, this is your show. And I think one thing that you've you've shown us, and your listeners that are that are watching this show are showing us is kind of the power of international solidarity. Um, I think it's hard for people to understand from an international level, but we're seeing it in real time right now with this show. Um, here's a question: How do you balance exposing the corruption and keeping yourself and your collaborators safe? Well, that's a that's a hard part of my job, I have to tell you. Um, I am not a journalist, uh, I don't, I didn't study about this on the university or stuff like that. Um, I don't have any information at all on what to do, on what to do, but what I what I try to to use is common sense, okay. So, for me as a person, this is a part of my life, this is not my life. I'm not happy if I have I don't know, a thousand people on a live streaming, and I'm not sad if I have 200 people on a live streaming, okay? Because I am not a YouTube channel, I am not, as I told you before, I'm not Mickey Mouse, okay, I'm just a person, and uh, I try to. To live my life, to don't be spending too much time thinking about what's going on and acting, working, and putting some effort and trying to build something big, something important. And that's my personal approachment to this. But in the other hand, I have to say that there's lots of people that speak with me, some of them daily, some of them once a week, some of them, I don't know, once a month. But for me, the most important thing is I don't need to give any information that can be used against my little birds, let's say. So there's lots of things that I know that I cannot say because I put some person in dangers. And for me, most of the little birds are regular persons, waiters, people who drive a taxi or common guys. So I cannot put them on any danger. And I just use common sense. I speak with them. I spend a lot of time, more time than what I think, speaking with them and trying to build them up. But at the end of the day, it is up to me. I decide what I do, what I don't do. And the main thing for me is not to keep the information, it's not the numbers, it's not the followers, it's not all that. It's to keep people safe. And that's it. We have another, we have another super chat. Humiliation makes Yossima great. Saludos. I think they mean humility, but yes, I agree. Also, when you know what someone is trying to say, you know, don't belittle them if they say the word wrong. And that's nice people. A long time ago, when I was on tour in Juarez, Mexico, someone was explaining to me communication. And the person, we used to get a driver into Mexico because it was very dangerous at the time to drive into that part of Mexico. And he would say, You understand what I'm saying, even when I say the words wrong. I was like, Yeah, he goes, And you never correct me. I go, No, because I understand what you're saying. He goes, Because that's what communication is. If you understand what someone is saying, you don't have to correct him. That's you could be so rude when you do that. So I understood what he was saying. Don't correct him, guys. What he was trying to say was humility. He's probably poor man, is probably using Google Translate. Google Translate has ruined so many relationships for me because it's not good. Not at all. What's happening in Uruguay is unique, but is it just a larger pattern in global football? Well, I in some port, it is. In all the part, it isn't. I think you find some stuff in the Uruguayan football that you can't find anywhere all over the world. But the background is the same because football is not controlled by people who loved our sport. It's controlled by people who loved our money. That's it. And they do everything to put us on a big trouble to decide every weekend if we pay to watch our team or not. And this is not like a shop where you can decide if you buy some shirt or if you don't buy it. If you got more money, you're going to buy more seats. And there's just shirts. Who cares? Football is a passion. As I told you, I support Real Madrid. When I watch my team playing, it's not about 11 guys kicking the ball. For me, it's like some kind of way to reach off with my grandfather, which is not here anymore, with my father, with my brother, even if they are away. Yes, what we have in common, the thing that made us cry together, smile together, and is more than a product. More than something that you can just buy, and they know that they know that, and that's why football is so important because we can't live without club. I can't live without a shirt or shoes or socks, I can live without some things, but I can't live without football. And that's the main thing. That's the main thing. And in Uruguay, this is happening in an exaggerated way because they are crazy about football, but literally crazy about football. They live football in a very special way, in a very passionated way, which makes me remember the old days here in Europe. Right now is not like that anymore, I'm afraid to say. But that's the thing. Everything in football is about money, so we've got good passion on the grounds, on the stadiums, all over the world. But the clubs are owned by bad people. The broadcasting companies are owned by bad people. The players are owned by bad people. And bad people came here because of the money. And that's it. I want to first of all, again, thank you for taking the time to talk to me. This has been, for me, a very moving interview because for me, doing a left political show, people always say, why do you talk about sports? No one cares about sports, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's a show on the channel that doesn't get as many views as some of the other political content. But I agree with you when it comes to, and I think you put it so beautifully, so eloquently, the relationship that so many of us have with Portes and how it brings people together. It's one of the greatest mass organizing tools, you know, it is. These football matches, right? We're all going to be yelling in unison, even if we're talking to people that support a different team, we're still talking to people in the same space. You know, it's these things are truly, truly important organizing tools and can get us talking about bigger and larger issues. And when you're exposing something like the corruption of not just a sport, but a country, you've organized the people for something much larger than just a game. So that for me is, again, really important and moving me emotionally just to think about it. Where do you see this movement going next? Are there cracks forming in the system that you've exposed? Well, I think there are, but for me, there's something about our sport that is right now reaching out this question. In football, there's people that think that everything what counts is to win. No matter what you do, you have to win. If you have to cheat, you cheat. If you have to kill someone, you killed someone, but you have to win. Okay. I don't think like that. But there's people that live like this. And right now, we are living a hard moment because this broadcasting company called Temfil is in a bad position. The contract that they've got with that contract, they control all the Uruguayan football from top to bottom, everything. Okay. This is running out. And this contract expires on December 31st. So they got everything, all the guns bouncing right now in all the things that you can imagine. They are menacing people, menacing all the companies. They are doing everything to keep the Uruguayan football under control. Okay. And for me, those people that are telling me right now, or me and my company, if you don't kick out Tenfil, like if I have the possibility or is in my hand, it's not in my hands, it's in people's hands, not in my hands. But it is right now it is so complicated to understand. But the thing is, if Tenfil continues, then we lost and everything was. Was for nothing. We didn't do anything, we didn't win, blah, blah, blah. But for me, the battle is just a battle, and we don't have to win every battle. We have to win the war. And the war is larger. The war is going to take us time. It's going to take us years. And that war is not about Tenfil, it's not about a contract. It's about people and it's about people to think that it's not right that a company called Tenfil or whatever company in the world, a company is making $40 million profit per year in a country where the football players are poor. Well, the football players are struggling. They don't, there's months that they don't get paid. You know what I mean? So everything is bad. And the thing is, they think that this is normal. Uruguayan football has to be like that. And they put in the TV some advertising with this is Uruguayan football. And they put a guy with a call with a co in the middle of the pitch, okay? And everything what is bad. And they try to make laugh on the poorest football of Sudamerica. And for me, that's bad. We have to fight against this situation because this is not deserved. People pay a lot of money all over the year on the membership of the club, of the T V channel, on everything. And all that money is being taken away, is being taken away from years and years and years by this company. Okay. And that's but how is it possible that those journalists in Uruguay that I've got all the pictures because I've got all the little birds all over the country, I've got all the pictures. Journalists in Uruguay driving cars like cost $100,000, okay? And those football players that they don't earn money, they don't get paid. This is unreal. Can you imagine something like that in other countries? Yeah, that's super crazy. We have a question from the show. One of our viewers wants to know: is there any big stars from Uruguay playing in Europa that have said anything about the situation in Uruguay? I mean, there has been some of them, some of them, not in this generation actually, but in the other generation. We can put a few names, okay? Codin, Lugano, the person that has been following football knows these guys, okay? But the thing is, this is quite interesting, Jason, because money is all over. Lugano, Diego Lugano, was the captain of the national team of Uruguay. He was one of the main guys that was telling we have to end that with Temfil, we have to put Temfil out, we have to fight for the players' conditions, blah, blah, blah. But at the end of the day, Jason, Lugano is a guy that wants the commission. If he doesn't get the commission, he doesn't care about anything. So, my way of thinking: if you try to change some things, you don't have to ask for a commission in this situation. There's people who are not getting paid. You know what I mean? So, for me, that's hard. That's hard to understand and that's hard to explain, but this is what is going on. And it's sad. It's sad because they have been professional football players in South America, in Europe. They've got money. They don't need money. Okay? They want more money, but they don't need it. Yosima, again, thank you so much for your bravery. Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. I know it's a little later in the day where you are in Spain. This was, I don't want to say difficult, but we were able to make it work. Usually we do these sports shows on Wednesday on Miraculous. I can't say, again, my Spanish is banned. Don't make fun of me. Or make fun of me. It doesn't matter. But I'll do the show whenever I can do the show. And hopefully, we can bring you back on the show at some point and talk more football, maybe from a more analytic standpoint, where we just break down the game itself and not have to have these, for me, emotional conversations about the power of solidarity, the power of regular people standing up to insurmountable odds. I mean, I love Star Wars, and that's what that whole movie franchise is really about. So that's who you are. You are the Cassian and or of Uruguayan football. Of football toromundo. He is. Yosima, wherever you are watching and listening to this show, there should be a link in the description to his podcast. La Lucura de la La, Belissima? Bielsa. Bielsa. La Lacura. La Locura de Bielsa. Okay. That's it. Perfect. Jeff got it perfect. So thank you again for taking the time to talk with me and have a good rest of your day. Well, thank you for having me. You know where to find me. And if I got the time and you have to speak about football, I've been here. Ah, see, hey, hey, hey, yo, takeo tu email. The correlo del tonico. I can contact you now. You don't have to have a mediary. And big shout out to Gus, TIR listener that reached out to me and said, I might know a guy. Let me try to contact him. Would you be down to do this show? And I said, of course, I'd be down to do the show. I joke. Look, yo, I joke with the audience so much. They get mad at me because they're like, you don't talk about soccer. And I'm like, nope, not gonna. Take that. Get your own show. But it wasn't so much that I just don't want to do it. It's that I don't, my co-hosts and I don't have the knowledge and I don't feel comfortable. I can make some stuff up and I could pretend, but you know, you might as well do it. If I was once told, and I believe this is something that you do in your life, anything you do, do it with passion. Yeah. I used to cook. I used to cook on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico with very angry rednecks. And I was having the worst day. And they could see I was having a bad day. So they're being really, really mean to me. And the head chef came in and he moved me out of the way. He goes, Whatever you do, because they called me California because I'm from California. He goes, do it with passion. He goes, you flip these funk-ass eggs. He flipped the egg over. He goes, you do it with passion. So that has been my motto of life. And you do things with passion. So we appreciate you. Have a very good rest of your day, brother. And thank you very much. Okay. Thank you so much for having me. And that's it. My pleasure. Peace out. My God. What a show. Tomorrow, movie night.
