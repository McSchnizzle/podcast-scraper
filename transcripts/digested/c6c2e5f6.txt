[CONVERSATION DETECTED - Multiple speakers likely present]

I've been thinking about how hate is being monetized online, and we need to talk about it today. So, over the last week or so, since I've been away at this residency, away from the internet, I've checked in here and there. I've seen a lot of the debate around Jubilee, Mehdi Hassan being invited on, him versus 20 conservatives/slash/alt-right people, him being asked what his ethnicity is, people tell him straight to his face that he should be kicked out of the country, him saying that he doesn't debate with fascists, the guy on there admitting to being a fascist, and then getting kicked out of his job. And I think he also started to go FundMe. And it all raises all these fucking questions about the internet, about social media, about the implications of AI and critical thinking, about our current wave of fascism and disinformation. And it's been giving me this central question of what does it mean for hate to be monetized? And I started thinking of these different eras throughout U.S. history, whether it be the edgelord culture of the early 2000s, or televangelism, which I was obsessed with researching about a year ago for my novel, or the current contemporary kind of landscape where people like Candice Owens can be ousted from the more traditional parts of the Republican Party during the Trump election and now has a platform on YouTube where her broadcasts are watched by millions of people. Begs a lot of questions around what liberalism has done to discourse online or the demand for discourse with Nazis and fascists. It also brings up questions around our relationship to media as viewers and consumers of it. Are we watching news? Are we watching content? Are we watching disinformation? How do we distinguish all of these different categories? And how have we ended up here? This video is going to be helpful for folks that are trying to navigate the hate-filled internet landscape that want to understand if or how the internet can be a site for cultural revolution or lack thereof, and some perspectives that we can walk away with once we look at how conservatives and the alt-right, just like any other ideological wing, has been wielding the parasocial nature of media for decades. And now we're at another turn in this horrific road towards oblivion, destruction. When you look down, what do you see? You don't see anything. It means you're not wearing any ribbons. It means you're a bigot. It means you're a racist. It means you're a sexist. It means you're a we are in a moment where Jubilee videos platform fascists and Nazis for views, but it's under the guise of showing human-like dialogue where people have to debate their humanity. And this raises the question: how do we fight a culture war when hate is monetizable? First, I want to dig into what I view as the shift in media from the 1980s into the 1990s and 2000s. If you said that you won't fly commercial, you said that it's like getting into a tube with a bunch of demons. In the book Messengers of the Right, Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics by Nicole Hemmer, the author explores the rise and transformation of conservative media. There, I uncovered a network of activism far broader and far more influential than I expected. Beginning in the late 1940s and 50s, activists working in media emerged as leaders of the conservative movement. Not only did they start an array of media enterprises, publishing houses, radio programs, magazines, book clubs, television shows, they built the movement. They coordinated rallies, founded organizations, ran political campaigns, and mobilized voters. From the archives, they emerged as a distinct group that I call media activists. Men and women, but mostly men, whose primary sites of activism were media institutions they founded. While they disagreed profoundly on tactics and strategy, they shared a belief that political change stemmed not just from ideas, from the proper expression and diffusion of those ideas through ideological media sources. And a section of the book that I find particularly interesting is when they break down liberal media bias and elite populism. So I want to dig into those as things that characterize this sort of conservative media swing. And in the text, it reads, The consequences of their leadership were profound. First and foremost, media activists crafted and popularized the idea of liberal media bias. This concept that established media were not neutral, but slanted towards liberalism, not only shaped the movement, but remade American journalism. We have grown so used to this claim that it is hard to comprehend just how radical an idea it was in the 1940s and 50s. After all, this was an era where institutional neutrality was considered the special genius of the American system. In a world roiling with terrors of fascism, totalitarianism, and communism, American politicians and intellectuals celebrated the technocratic state and its attendant institutions as spaces free from passions, from the passions and pitfalls of ideology. To wit, two years after the publication of Harvard sociologist Bell's 1960 book, The End of Ideology, President John F. Kennedy declared that the major domestic challenges of the era do not relate to the basic clashes of philosophy and ideology, but to the ways and means of reaching common goals. When an outlet like the New York Times criticized a liberal policy, conservative media activists presented it not as evidence of the paper's even-handedness, but as evidence of the policy's failure. Even the liberal New York Times had to admit, dot dot dot. Thus, evidence that seemed to undermine the charge of liberal bias could be reinterpreted to support it. Elite populism was a distinguishing feature of conservative media activism from the start. Though the elite part was seldom in question, the populist part took a while to fully develop. When their activism was simply a matter of formulating arguments and creating a sense of conservative identity among far-flung readers and listeners, it didn't particularly matter if they represented a minority. Populism flavored their work, but functioned largely as a lineage to the past. The first generation of media activists saw themselves operating in a populist tradition that extended back to the American founding. They compared their work to that of Thomas Paine, raising the cry of revolution while laying the groundwork for a fundamentally new type of government, and to that of William Lloyd Garrison demanding an end to slavery at a time when abolitionism was considered at best eccentric and at worst seditious. Drawn to iconoclasts, media activists constructed a lineage that was as radical as it was conservative. If the establishment was liberal, then they would dedicate themselves to demolishing it. And we're starting here because I personally have been really invested into learning about televangelism over the past year, on and off. I've been writing a novel set in the late 1980s, and through a bunch of my drafts and research, I started getting into like, what is televangelism? And it basically opened up this Pandora's box of like, oh, this is a part of American culture that seems recognizable to me. Televangelism is the rise of televised evangelical religious services that came out of the 1980s. We have very prominent figures standing in the office of the prophet of God. I execute judgment on you, COVID-19. I execute judgment on you, Satan. You destroyer! This became such a religious fervor in the 1980s because cable, MTV, the hyper-consumerism of the 1980s, alongside the religious zealots of the time, created this very interesting social production known as televangelism. And one of the biggest figures in televangelism of this time period is Kenneth Copeland, who was one of the wealthiest televangelists and the founder of Kenneth Copeland Ministries. His media peak was from the 1980s to the 1990s. It's said that his net worth was upward of $300 million. And once you dig more into him, Kenneth Copeland was born December 3rd, 1963. He was an American televangelist associated with the Charismatic movement. He preaches prosperity theology and is a part of the world of faith movement, which teaches that divine favor is expressed in material and financial blessing. This is a part of Kenneth Copeland's kind of whole approach to televangelism that I found interesting. You can watch some of his services and it's like, give this for God and give this for God. And God means that you need to give as much to the church and there's prosperity. On May 27, 1971, KCM began a one-hour television program called The World of Faith. 1972, the television group called The Prayer Group was launched. This wasn't half an hour television program aired across the U.S. 1989. The weekly show The Word of Faith was replaced by a daily series called Believers Voice of Victory. He was an ardent supporter of Israel. In August of 2022, the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog, called and personally thanked Copeland and KCM for their support of the Ukrainian and Russian Jews. In 2020, he was listed by the Israel Allies Foundation as one of the top supporters of Israel, alongside Paul White, John Hagee, Mike Huckabee, and other Christian leaders. And we can see with headlines that he was America's richest pastor, avoiding $150,000 in annual taxes on a $7 million Texas mansion that he said God told him to build, according to Business Insider. And the photo they have here is just fucking orange. You know, when you look at white people and you're just kind of like, this man looks evil. He looks evil. In 1999, Kenneth Copeland built an $18,000 square foot mansion in Texas by calling it parsonage. He avoided $150,000 in property taxes. And Copeland, according to when this article was out, is worth $750 million and is the head of Eagle Mountain International Church. According to an article from 2016, he said Christians who don't vote for Donald Trump are going to be guilty of murder. And he's been noted numerous times saying that it's none of anyone's fucking business how he uses his private jet. And that went viral a number of years ago. These people were able to build such exorbitant platforms, were able to raise such exorbitant amounts of money, able to use personality and

Religiosity to make their fat cat elite consumerist desires somehow tie to divinity. And when I think about fascism as we're seeing it materialize today and how I've read about it, fascism doesn't work based on fact. Fascism doesn't try to look at the material facts of your reality and argue about those. It's going to lie, create the conditions to make that lie more plausible and possible. For someone who's a preacher or a pastor who has a $7 billion jet, $6 billion, $7 billion lakefront mansion, you need to use your religiosity to insulate and defend the shit in his own creek. I mean, he used donations to buy jets in real estate. In 2020, Kenneth Copeland falsely claimed to blow COVID-19 away by the breath of God on live TV. And he defended his private jet usage by saying that commercial planes were full of demons. And I think I'm also interested in how each of these eras of alt-right media really leaned into the parasocial nature of things. And so when we think about televangelism, we can talk about how it pioneered the intimate preacher-audience relationship through direct-to-camera monologues and personal prayer time, about people calling in and asking for the preacher or pastor to pray for them, about speaking to the camera and saying, I'm talking to you and your family at home, and we're addressing you as you sit there as a hypocrite who can't advocate for the things that I or God or the divine ruler wants. Fighting for family values was equated with voting Republican, how creating the emotional spiritual dependency model, portraying the host as a spiritual authority, moral guide, political voice. Someone who's so politically centered and trusted that no matter how much money they spend, they are always going to be godlike. They are always going to be godlike. Cults, about how cults demand that you hand over your life, your secrets, your privacy, your resources for the sake of a greater good. It almost replicates the fact that we pay taxes to vote in a government and in elections that aren't usually representative of democracy when it comes to federal elections. How, on a local level, there is still so much money and ego and clout in politics. The emotional spiritual authority becomes even more important. And we can even kind of see that with some of the confusion of like, is Trump religious or not? Has he ever actually read the Bible? Does it actually just matter more that to some people he represents a godlike kind of America? Viewers felt that their faith and patriotism were under siege. So this reinforced loyalty and ongoing donations. And so in the 1980s, where we have satanic panic, we have the rise of rock and sexual media and MTV and Madonna. There was this kind of cultural notion that religion could help heal the sins of the nation and the country. And let me remind you again. Let me remind you again. He is worth $700 million. Like, how much did he make per episode? It's fucking wild. Preposterous that Caucasians are blamed for slavery when they've done more to end it than any other race. They have discovered that Obama does have slave blood. Slave blood. I had never experienced the kind of euphoria that I got from a pain. To bring back a text that we were reading earlier in this video called Messengers of the Right, I want to bring in some of the context that it offers to this era of talk show, radio, and broadcast journalism of the 90s and 2000s. The second generation of media activists were entertainers first, conservatives second. Limbaugh, the radio pioneer, started as a disc jockey. Radio host Glenn Beck got a start as a morning zoo shock jock. The cornerstone personalities of the new conservative cable network, Fox News, founded in 1966, were also pulled from the ranks of entertainers. Bill O'Reilly came up through Network News, working on the tabloid Insight Edition before moving to Fox News. Fellow Fox News personality Steve Dosi started out as a host of House Party with Steve Dossi on NBC, as well as a children's show, Not Just News. The entertainment background often came at the expense, at the expense of formal education. For the first generation of conservative media activists, education was key. Buckley went to Yale. Regnery went to MIT and Harvard. Rusher to Princeton and Harvard Law. Mannion to Catholic University in Notre Dame. O'Reilly banked impressive credentials from Marist University, Boston University, and Harvard's Kennedy School. But Beck, Limbaugh, and Sean Hannity, the top 10 conservative radio hosts of the 2000s, all lacked college degrees. None of which is to suggest the second generation of media activists lacked intelligence, but rather that their backgrounds reflected a different type of training, one that allowed them to construct more authentic, seeming populism than did the ivy-draped education of their predecessors. But this large cast of characters was still offstage during the first Bush administration. The better part of a decade, from his national syndication to 1988 to the launch of Fox News in 1996, conservative media was Limbaugh. Print publications abounded, but continued to struggle economically, and television remained a puzzle. Limbaugh's show, which ran for four years, was moderately successful. Yet, while the set got sleeker and the production got more professional, the medium never gave Limbaugh the sort of thrill he got from radio. In mid-1966, he announced that despite his promise to stay on air until the nation had converted to conservatism, he was ending the show. Fox News represented the culmination of a half a century of conservative hopes. Conservatives had fostered the dream of their network for decades, circulating schemes that generated enthusiasm but not results, so long as they were just a handful of major networks. But cost and institutional inertia forestalled an ideological takeover. It simply required too much money to buy out shareholders at NBC or CBS, who at any rate were not interested in selling. The introduction of cable TV services broke that monopoly while introducing another. It took more than a year, for instance, for Fox News to become available in New York City, where Time Warner's control of Manhattan and Brooklyn cable blocked distribution. Not until the rise of digital cable could multiple cable networks channels compete in the same markets. Even before the September 11th attacks and the Iraq War stimulated the American appetite around the clock news, Fox News' programming was breaking through. By early 2001, the O'Reilly Factor, an opinion show hosted by Bill O'Reilly, topped the ranks of cable news programming. The channel's top-rated show, The O'Reilly Factor, captured the difference between CNN and Fox News. CNN, tying its reputation to reportage and interviews, relied heavily on network-style news packages. Fox News, at least in the prime-time opinion programming, borrowed heavily from the world of talk-talk radio, personality-driven, overtly partisan, and laced with an edge of vitro. After the September 11th attacks, MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN were toe-to-toe-to-toe for a share of the rapidly growing audience, and Fox News came out on top. Even six months after the attack, when CNN's MSNBC's audiences plummeted from their September highs, Fox News remained relatively steady. Rush Limbaugh is a definitive figure of this era because his nationally syndicated radio show reshaped U.S. conservatism. With over 15 million weekly listeners, he created a loyal base addicted to outrage. Limbaugh mainstreamed racist jokes, anti-immigration rhetoric, and sexist slurs under the barrier of free speech. He also mocked Aids Vid's victims and is noted in an article to have said that Michael J. Fox was exaggerating his Parkinson's for public sympathy. Also blamed Democrats for mass shootings and environmental disasters. And his pioneering approach brought immense success. Limbaugh was first ranked among the world's highest paid entertainers in 1994 at number 36 with pre-tax earnings of 25 million. This is a disgusting individual. Supported the war on terror, spread disinformation consistently on his talk show, was able to speak to millions and millions of people on a consistent basis. And if we think about the proliferation of the social media and internet, if we think about the wave of media representation and who's creating the stuff that we're consuming has shifted so much, it is interesting to think about the post-9/11 era as an era where xenophobia was so much more in the mainstream, where these more regressive politics, which had to support the war on terror, and us searching for the weapons of mass destruction and trying to take down al-Qaeda. This involved a lot of disinformation and a lot of lying and a lot of falsehoods in the media landscape. Easiest ways to translate this was through radio, a platform that so many older folks were much used to listening to. I think about growing up and visiting my grandmother at her house and how she'd either be watching the mainstream news, she'd either be watching her soap operas, or she'd be listening to the radio. And granted, I don't think my grandma listened to like Rush Limbaugh or whatever. Like the reliance on previous forms of media and information gathering when there are innovations such as cable TV, social media, the internet, etc. Rush Limbaugh, because of his reach, because of how often he did his talk radio show, because people were able to call in, he was also able to innovate this parasocial relationship that people were able to have to alt-right and conservative politics. Hosts like Limbaugh innovated the everyman elite persona, acting like a regular Gly while claiming access to insider truths. Emphasized listener loyalty and identity. If you didn't agree with Rush, you were a part of them, not us. And this is in his language again and again and again. The monologues that he did and how he referred to these people as ditto heads. Fans didn't just agree, they echoed Limbaugh's identity by calling themselves Ditto heads. So reinforcing this parasocial relationship, once again, by giving your audience or allowing your audience to give themselves a fan-based name, this makes me think about like the cult of celebrity, about Bayhive, about even people online being like, Hey, besties, welcome back to my channel. And granted, when I'm doing these videos, I say hi, but it's more of like a way for me to enter the zone of being on camera. Once again, he was able to weaponize this space to the point that his fans started calling themselves ditto heads, and this reinforced.

Social bond with in-group language and mockery of outsiders. How Colin's segments fostered a sense of personal interaction, even though the relationship was one way. And this is how the daily outrage cycle was born. Posts would guide listeners through a list of enemies, whether it be liberals, feminists, the media, and this would begin to be a daily kind of format that allowed them to revisit these tried and true pillars that would bring people in through populism. Illegal alien Bill of Rights. We're now governed by people who do not like the country. Who is Obama? Why is he doing this? The Obama era, the war on terror, edgelord culture, and the hope of a post-racial America. The early 2000s marked a shift that after 9-11, fear around terrorism, fear around the other, fear around Muslims, around Arabs was at an all-time high. This investment into national security, the fact that the Department of Homeland Security didn't exist until after 9-11, the fact that metal detectors in airports. And so this culture around terror and terrorism and the need to protect what is truly American became at the forefront. And this cultural identity around national security kind of surged. And Barack Obama's presidency from 2008 to 2016 symbolized a sort of hope in this time period of edgelord culture and edgelord political commentary: 2016, 2014, 2015, how BLM kind of upspiked on college campuses. We saw these movements spread, the reaction in the media about Trump running for president, around these alt-right male figures like Milo Yiannopoulos and Richard Spencer and Gavin McKine going on college tours and speaking tours. And this really became a time period where our engagement with social media, really, really more than ever was able to color the 2016 election. I think about edgelord culture as the guys that would say, Hitler's great, oh my god, and they're arguing on Twitter and they're using bots, and they're able to build these vitriolic platforms based on sort of being on mainstream political outsiders that could find their smaller audiences online. How did platforms like YouTube and early social media enable political provocateurs to monetize their outrage? And why did this approach appeal specifically to younger, disenfranchised white audiences? And this era also mixed with the decentralized nature that social media was kind of entering created these kind of new instances where I think people were unable to kind of process the kind of platforms that these internet figures were able to garner. Piece that was mentioned here, which is Substack has a Nazi problem by John M. Katz. The newsletter hosting site Substack advertises itself as the latest best hope for civility on the internet and aspires to a bigger role in politics in 2024. But just underneath the surface, the platform has become a home and propagator of white supremacy and anti-Semitism. Substack has not only been hosting writers who post overtly Nazi rhetoric on the platform, it profits from many of them. Substack, founded in 2017, has terms of service that formally prescribe hate along with pornography, spam, and anyone with restricted, and anyone restricted from making money on Substack, a category that includes businesses banned by Stripe. Platform's default payment processor. But Substack's leaders also probably disdain the content moderation methods that other platforms employ, albeit with spotty results, to limit the spread of racist or bigoted speech. Any informal search of the Substack website and of extremist Telegram channels that circulate Substack posts turn up scores of white supremacists, neo-Confederate, and explicitly Nazi newsletters on Substack. Many of them apparently started in the last year. These are, to be sure, a tiny fraction of the newsletters on a site of more than 17,000 paid writers as of March. And I think when we talk about social media and Substack and these more decentralized forms of media, I remember after Trump lost in 2020, a big point of discussion that I saw online was that the media space needed to prepare for what would be coming inevitably in four years when people believed that Trump would win again, which he did, running in 2024 and becoming president at the beginning of this year. One thing that people talked about is that even though Biden won, the people that were disgruntled about Trump losing, that believed that the election was rigged, that were able to feed into all of the disinformation, the politicians that were laughed out of office or kicked out by the mainstream Republicans or were ousted, those people went back to their cities, went back to their jobs, licked their wounds, and started to build platforms that became the foundation for the alt-right media space that we see today. The disgruntled Trump supporters that didn't believe that Biden actually won and believed that women need to shut the fuck up and have their bodies controlled. Those people were able to build entire platforms online through rage baiting, through spreading disinformation, through delving into the manosphere. And I think we can see so many of the signs and the writings on the wall. I mean, I think about how platforms like Facebook, run by Mark Zuckerberg, peeled back so many of their hate speech infringement and policies over the last number of years. And essentially, what we see in the media space is that content matters simply because it is able to be used and manipulated for ad dollars, for profit, and for reach. There are so many things about emerging fascism, the aesthetics of it, internet culture, our social and political policing of ourselves and each other that I think is really evident in all the things happening right now. Like, if I were to retitle this video and it's going to be retitled low-key, it's not when hate was monetized, it's when fascism was fucking monetized. Because if I think of my definition of fascism, which are things that I listed earlier, a malevolent and charismatic leader that has come to remedy all of our social wrongs, but with no accountability for themselves, a desire to pillage the land and purify it through extraction or displacement of indigenous people to put Eurocentric people there. A hyper-selective government or political entity that spreads disinformation or conspiracy theories and then creates the social, economic, and political conditions for these theories to become technically true or supposedly true. Mass reliance on censorship and the firing of political opponents and media and education. Creating or further funding systems that can lead to immediate or indefinite detention of political opponents or others without due process. The demand for a subhuman, other controlling of resources or resource distribution or aid for their own gain. I mention these things because I think it's important for us to constantly revisit these definitions and to redefine them and to look at how they're happening today. Like when I tell you I've been at this residency mostly removed from the world, mostly removed from whatever, and I've been checking the news here and there. When I read yesterday that the corporation for public broadcasting is shutting down because the Trump administration has taken away a billion dollars in funding, so NPR, PBS, on the chopping block. I think about my childhood. I think about going home and watching, trying to fight to watch cable and not being able to, and watching public access TV. I remember avoiding the fucking 700 club or whatever, that racist, fucking conservative man, and watching PBS Kids, watching Cyber Chase, watching this, these forms of media that tried to offer young people altruism. And when I think about the mortal sins of our time, what this video was kind of trying to like edge towards, which is why I wanted to record this additional intro, it's the fact that our changing relationship to media and media consumption and the internet and social media has shifted our lives from consuming media on a few ads at the radio, or maybe when you're on the subway, or when you're watching your cable TV at night. Now with streaming, with cell phones, with social media, we're consuming media all the fucking time. And the fact that people can build entire careers, the fact that people can become millionaires, billionaires off of spreading content, ideology, messaging, media online, it creates this very strange parasocial dynamic where I think a lot of people don't know they're consuming fascist ideologies, fascist content. And we can look at gamers and Gamergate. We can look at Tradwife content. We can look at the eugenics of modern self-care and body care and being obsessed with one's self-image. We can look at the Sidney Sweeney ad with American, with American Eagle and talking about her genes. We can look at so many corners of the internet, Gamergate, Edgelord culture, fucking Manosphere. All of these things are pockets of the internet where fascist ideologies in parts or parcel or in fullness were once extradited to the edges. And now that we have a Trump administration where look at the people he's fucking hiring and putting into the government. People that work in WWE, people that work in tech, people that he can literally sell millions and billions of dollars worth of contracts to to further fund the war and genocides and mass displacement and mass erasure of due process and the mass detainment of people. And this is all in the internet age. And Trump started as a celebrity businessman. Charisma, even if it's for the sake of fascism, can win. And if we're looking at the internet, we're seeing the many, the fruits of their labor coming to the surface. And even being at this residency, like I've been talking to folks here about AI and tech, how tech progression is another sign of like fascist or imperialistic desires for the future, because if they're investing all of this tech and all this stuff that's going to help the fucking future, do you think they want immigrants there? Do you think they want black people there, queer people there? No. I've been learning about eco-fascism more since I've been here. Folks that want to purify the land so there can be better land for white people. And I think even being here and looking into like aura and cringe and looks maxing and nonchalance and this sort of demand for stoicism, especially a male stoicism.

I think of how my life as a queer person, as a gay person, as a black person has completely blown all that shit to the side. So I'm like, in this fascist future, unless I code switch all the time into whatever fucking whatever, which I don't want to. So it's just wild that my entire existence in many ways is antithetical to the Manosphere, antithetical to fascism. And it's why I think these key concepts are so clear to me, but it's important to crystallize them and to revisit them because I think in the internet age is fucking dangerous. If we don't know what is real information, if we don't know how to critically think, if we can't talk to each other, work through actual relationships and not just parasocial relationships, we have a very dangerous road ahead, a very, very dangerous road ahead. And it's a road that's already, we're already walking on the fucking road. People going after Trump being targeted and having federal probes, investigate federal probe investigations be set upon them. It sounds like fucking Quintel Pro. Fascism hasn't gone away. That liberalism calls fascism hate typically. In the internet age, it's our responsibility to be critical and intentional about what we consume, what we're learning, how we're learning, where we're learning it from. It's critical to create physical space where people can build community with each other, where people can learn from each other, where people can converse, talk, share ideas. And it's important to call out fascist ideology and fascist propaganda when we see it and to understand when people are sharing it, to be able to detect it. And in every era that we've explored in this video, people that succumb to populism, yes, this is a political process that happens. We're seeing it now. It's the jobs of the people around them to either build up a way of debate, criticality that can engage with the populism that our institutions and politicians and people online are deploying, or if they're Nazi, a fascist, fight them. That's what people have done historically. That's just what some of the evidence says. That's all I'm saying. When hate became monetized, when hate becomes monetized, when hate is monetized, when fascism is monetized. Sometimes I come up with videos and I'm like, okay. Okay.
