We experimented with this a little bit last year. We had a good time, so I'll be teaming with Parallax Views host JG Michael to give independent B movie cinema the respect it deserves. Often, when people hear the term B movie, they discard it as a lesser film, cheaply crafted, sleazy, an incoherent mess. And while that might be the case for some of these so bad they're good films, that isn't the case for all of them. Much like any other form of media, tastemakers decide what movies, music, or visual art is worthwhile and what is trite. This is where capitalist realism really comes into play. As much as we'd like to believe ourselves to be individualistic, we often fall prey to the stereotype that projects made outside of the big studios aren't going to be up to par. But it is the independent movie spirit that has actually created tools that would be adopted at the major studio level. There was a time where independent film was the best training ground for young actors, directors, producers, and of course, practical effects makers. This show for me is a love letter to all of the late-night, low-budget action, horror, thriller movies I watched as a kid that reminded me there were great stories left to tell that weren't dominated by the Hollywood hit machine. Hopefully, this show will turn you onto some movies to add to your watch list. Before I bring in JG, I just want to remind you that TIR is listener-funded. If you enjoy shows like this and all the irreverent madness we produce here on TIR, then become a patron for as little as $3 a month or $30 for the year. You can not only make sure we stay on air, but you can access our patron-only champagne rooms, call in shows, receive free copies of the crisis papers, and more. Also, after the main show tonight, for patrons and paid YouTube subscribers, we're going to watch the sequel to Sleepboy Camp. Looks like we're going to watch Sleepboy Camp 3. So if you want to join us, become a patron. There is a link in the description now. Sleepaway Camp the original versus the sequels. For many, the 1983 movie Sleepaway Camp was just a cut-and-paste copy of Friday the 13th, a slasher set in a summer camp with young people being picked off by an unseen stalker via first-person shots straight out of an Italian Giallo, minus the atmosphere and style. But I think Sleepaway Camp takes more risks than its critics give it credit for. The main character, the shy and almost mute Angela, is introduced as a deeply traumatized child. Years before the events of the film, she witnessed her father and brother die in a very preventable boating accident. We meet her living with her eccentric aunt Martha and cousin Ricky in a middle-class home. At first, Martha just seems like an oddball, but by the finale, we learn she's more mad scientist than doty aunt. Unlike the Friday the 13th films, Sleepaway Camp doesn't punish its victims for generic slasher sins like teenage promiscuity. Angela's killings are a direct reaction to extreme bullying and predatory behavior. In the first act, she's trapped by an adult male who attempts to sexually assault her. And throughout the movie, she's relentlessly tormented by the camp's mean girls. Angela's icy stare at the other girls, seemingly for no reason, becomes a source of discomfort for her peers. The truth only comes out in the final scene. Angela is actually Peter, her deceased brother, who was forced to live as a girl after Aunt Martha decided she wanted a daughter. The reveal culminates with the infamous moment where Angela is discovered naked, standing over a body, hissing, and visibly male. The shock here functions exactly like the twist endings in other slashers. Jason leaping from the lake in Friday the 13th, Miss Voorhees as the killer, meant to rattle the audience, not make a political statement. Sleepaway Camp was designed as a one-off, and the Angela twist was its mic drop moment. The later sequels existed for a different reason entirely: the 80s straight-to-video horror boom, where established IPs guaranteed rentals and sales. In these follow-ups, Angela is reimagined as fully transitioned, talkative, and a staunchly conservative, a camp counselor who murders campers for being immoral. By the end of the Reagan era, she had morphed into a slasher embodiment of reactionary values. Today, we'll look at those sleepaway camp sequels and ask the question: were they actually better than the original? To do that with me is the man from Parallax Views. He is the JG Michael. You need to plug something, JG? Yeah, real quick, I wanted to plug something. I have a friend, Fred Olin Ray, who's a big influence on me. Big, big B movie filmmaker. Did movies like Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers and can I say hookers on here? You can four times if you'd like. Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, Biohazard, all these great B movies from the 80s. He has an Indiegogo right now for Jacko 2. And if you don't know Jacko, it's a very weird, super low-budget movie from the 90s that sort of has cult fandom now. But Fred is making a sequel to it. And you can go to Indiegogo and just type in Jacko 2 Blood Moon Rising, make a movie with Fred Ol and Ray, and you'll find it there. If you like B movies, support Fred's work. He has a biography that just came out, and this new movie he's working on is going to have Sybil Danning in it. Jacko 2 Blood Moon Rising, also produced by William Griffey, who did the great snake horror movie Stanley back in the 70s. So if you're looking for like supporting indie cinema, go to Indiegogo, Jacko 2, Blood Moon Rising. I really support Fred's work. He's a huge inspiration for me as someone who loves like B movie and independent cinema. So I hope you guys will check that out. I wanted to plug that because they're really trying to raise funds for this movie. Well, make sure you send me the link and then we'll put it in the description of this show as well. Awesome. This movie for me, these movies for me were kind of part of my horror movie inauguration, if you will. When did you first see Sleepway Camp? I saw Sleepaway Camp when I was about 11. Okay. It came on cable one night. I had no idea what it was. Other than it sounded scary and anything scary that came on. I think it was either Friday or Saturday night on one of the cable networks. I think it was Cinemax. It was generally going to be a horror movie. And my mother worked a crazy overnight shift. So I had a lot of alone time as a young person. So I got to watch these movies. And I first watched Sleep Away Camp. And again, not knowing anything about it. There is no internet to tell me about it. There's no blog sites to tell me about it. It wasn't talked about that much in horror magazines of the day. Because again, I saw it in 87, 80, maybe 88, 89. And when I saw it, you know, it's a movie that you can follow, right? It's done well. People are dying. Bad people are dying. There's a lot of like teen sex comedy hijinks too, as well as the slashing. There's a lot of boobs. There's a lot of boobs. There's that scene where they let a farm on fire. There's more boobs into. If you know me personally, then you know my fashion sense. A lot of it comes from the sleep away camp. One. I'm not afraid to wear short shorts or midriff tops. But beyond that, when the movie ended, I was blown away. And I remember going to school and trying to find anyone that knew this film because this wasn't a popular movie. By the time we're all watching, if you're of my generation, by the time you're watching horror movies, Freddy is popular IP. Jason is popular IP. And Michael Myers is about to be Texas Chainsaw is about to be popular IP, but definitely Freddy. So this is like, what? Is this 87 for you or 88? So Michael's about to make his big screen comeback with Alloe 4. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So you know, I just want to set it in a timeframe so people can really wrap their minds around it. And we're starting to get into the sequels. What do you think of the disco theme, Angela's theme from Sleepwake? That's like an earworm for me. When I look into your eyes, it comes as no surprise. It's just what I've been looking for. What I love about these movies, if you really get into, especially the stuff in the early 80s that were still made for cinemas and drive-ins, they actually had scores and soundtracks where, you know, hey, Johnny's got a band. Why don't we pay him a couple bucks to make it? There's actually some memorable bands in the sequels that did the stuff for the soundtrack. Dead Milkman, the great punk band, is in the second movie, I believe. The sequels are definitely of a certain time where, again, post-Nightmare 3, we learn that heavy metal fans are big horror fans. And it also feels like, and we can get more into this if you like. The sequels feel like these were made for a certain type of viewer, right? Also, all bad kids look like they just stepped off of a Slayer video set from 1988. Everyone's got a leather jacket, the kind of motorcycle jacket, fingerless gloves. There's a lot of metal. There's a lot of metal in all these movies, which was another big factor for me. But going back to the original, that is a movie of its time that you don't really get anymore. Like you said, about Angela's theme. There's a song about the movie in the song. Frankly, that is a very early 80s thing, a very early 80s thing. Even movies that were more popular with bigger budgets, like what is it called? Just One of the Guys. That is the there's a song the movie starts off with that's explaining to you the movie as you watch it. Very, very common. But we, it's over by the time the second wave of these horror movies come into play. Right. And the NPAA is going crazy at this point. Yeah, this movie's also before PG-13. You're right, JG. This is way before PG-13. So when I found out that there was a sequel to the movie, which I saw at a video store, I lost my mind. I was like, I got to save my lunch money, which consisted of like, don't eat for a couple days and then, you know, make the trek down to the local blockbuster by this point. Now, what did the VHS cover look like? Was that the other woman? It was the woman that had nothing. See, Slipway Camps and Three are crazy. Unhappy campers and Teenage Wasteland are crazy because the VHS box art has nothing to do with it. That's Jason Volume. There's a Jason Voorhees mask and like a Freddy glove. See, that part makes sense, but the actress is on the covers. But the actress is not in the movie. It's just a hot woman. But you know what else I heard, speaking of women not in the movie? I spit on your grave, the butt. It's Demi Moore. Demi Moore. Did not know that. Didn't know that till like maybe three, four weeks ago. I thought I would have told you that. No, I didn't. You didn't tell me that. I didn't know that. But back to Sleep Away Camp. When the sequel comes out, and I re-watched the sequel this morning and I was watching part three before we started the show. When the sequel hits, and I did watch the, I was like, okay, how are they going to do this Angela thing? Because that's the whole thing in part one. It's the reveal. And as I was watching part one, it took me back to Friday the 13th part one. And I don't know if it's the same for you. When you watch Friday the 13th part one and you don't know about Jason Voorhees, his name is mentioned, I think, once at the end when she's telling you the impetus for why she's killing these camp counselors. It's because of her son, Jason. And you don't even know about Pamela because I don't think you see her at all in the movie. It's all from her perspective, if I'm not mistaken, right? Kills. Not all the kills, but it's a lot of kills. I think you see her at one point, but yeah, they don't show. Yeah. So watching Sleep Away Camp, they're taking a lot from that movie. But one thing that's missing is killing teenagers for bad behavior. And I don't agree whatsoever with the trope of the moralizing in these movies. The reason why teenagers get killed for bad behavior is because you can show titties. It's all about titties. Nobody cares about why they get killed. You know, it's weird? Not to kill titties. Not to interrupt you, but in a weird way, if you were to watch, see, Friday the 13th is actually a ripoff. It's a movie that rips off Bay of Blood, the great, not Dario Shinto, Mario Bava. Yeah. The great Mario Bava movie. And that movie, if you watch it from beginning to end, is much more moralizing. Not moralizing necessarily in a right-wing way. It's sort of commenting on like parental neglect. But that movie is actually much more moralizing than Friday the 13th. Friday the 13th, I think, is weird because it's like, yes, the people who have sex get killed, but it's for titties. It's all they're thinking about is sex. And the one girl who can't get laid isn't thinking about sex, so she's more alert. I'm not sure that there's a moralism to it. I mean, Sean will say he doesn't, he didn't intend moralism in it, you know? And I mean, they're also making movies with a lot of boobs. That's all. Look, we have to be honest and stop. When you write an entire book about these tropes and the male gaze, look, a lot of that is bullshit. Watch one of these movies. Even the woman who wrote the essay on the male gaze is kind of annoyed with how that term has been used. So many people are like, oh, the tropes. No. These people have to sell a movie. You know how you sell a movie? Hey, dame, you want to be big in Hollywood? You want to show those tits? Because the tits come out for by the time you get to Sleepboy Camp 3, the unnecessary tit is the opening scene where this girl is in this kind of gross room with dirty underwear all over the place. Oh, it's amazing. She's in those, she's in those leopard print panties. Oh, my gosh. And then she's like, and then the milkshake. She has the milkshake. The milkshake is tattooed on her, and she has very another thing that's actually kind of interesting. Is this before? I shouldn't say before, but before the ubiquity of fake boobs, where like only a certain person with a certain kind of money could pay for them. So she has regular small boobs. And the scene, the movie opens up with a not a large chested woman, but it does open up with boobs. And it's like, if you like tits in the last one, we're going to give you so many more tits. We're going to find reasons to give you tits. Is there such a thing as unnecessary boobage? Says Nuri. I don't know. I don't know. But it feels like those movies, it's less about killing kids for having sex and more like, okay, how can we transition from a kill? Okay, these kids will go fuck somewhere where no one's looking. And then the dude will get up and he'll be in really good shape. So we can either see his butt or his six-pack, but he's going to die. And then we'll see, you know, tits for no reason. And tits for no reason is going to die. All the time. Every time. But. This leads me to my first question for you. What for you makes Sleepaway Camp different from your standard 80 slasher, JG? Okay, first, can you hear me okay? Because I'm having an issue with my headphones. Yep, we can hear you just fine. You're not hearing any background, right? Nope. Nope. I'm hearing you through your microphone. Now you've stopped. Now you've disappeared. You've paused. But are there boobs in movies anymore? Says Charles Coast. Well, after this movie, we will be watching Sleepaway Camp 3. And there's definitely, like I said, it opens with boobs. So you're going to see a wide array of boobs and all natural. None of that fake tit stuff here on TIR. So JG disappeared. And while he comes back from the netherworld, you guys said boobs too much. There's a twist ending at the end of the original film where you are kind of led to believe the killer isn't Angela, but her cousin Ricky. And the guy that is the owner of the camp, who's also trying to cover up these murders, believes that her cousin Ricky is the murderer to the point where he's like, I got you. And he kind of captures him. And he's obsessed with the fact that Ricky is the murderer. And then you find out, you know, at the end, Angela's the killer. Then Angela hangs Dong. Angela hangs fucking Dong. And that's the shocking part for me. JG, did the twist ending make you? Yeah, I don't know what happened there. Maybe the NSA came in. What I, oh my God, that was like total system shutdown. My computer just shut off. So you were asking me about the original Sleepway Camp versus the sequels. Well, yeah, I was asking you about that. Like, what makes sleepway camp? I did not get to watch the original Sleepway Camp for this, and I don't revisit it that much. I like it a lot. I like it a great deal, actually. And I think it's a weird mix of like teen hijinks comedy. Like I said at the beginning, there's that, I think there's a whole scene where a bunch of the guy campers or the boys are like, they light a fart on fire. You know, there's a lot of teen hijinks, and then the killing comes, right? You know, and it's weird because I think you can see it as having comedic elements, but a lot of it's played straight, especially the ending, right? The shock reveal and whatnot. And it's an interesting movie because I know a lot of trans people that have turned it into sort of like the trans Avenger movie. You know, it's like, yeah, Angela rolls, kill all these freaking. Is it kind of like the same way that the gay people felt about Nightmare 2 kind of making a tear movie? Even more so than that, because I think, and I don't disagree with them. I think there's trans people that sort of want to reclaim Angela as like an Avenger because she goes after bullies and people that are jerks in the first movie. Even in the second movie, although I think more so in the third movie, you know, she really goes after like people that I hate. But in the first, I mean, she goes after a pedophile in the first movie, the pedophile cook. There's things in this movie, too. I want to, you know, we have to also place it. We're talking about this movie probably way over the head of the movie as well, because when they're making the movie, the pedophile cook is such a pedophile that you would assume his co-workers would be like, hey, I don't want to work with this dude. He's kind of a piece of shit. Aren't we supposed to say like PDF file now? Because like YouTube don't fuck it. I don't fuck him. No, I'm not going to change the way I talk for that shit. No, I hate that. And then you walk in the real world and someone's like, so and so, stop talking like that because some fucktart is afraid that he might get demonetized. If that's what it is, it's what it is. But these words aren't going to hurt you. I'm describing something. So the guy that's a kid fucker, is that better? Kid fucker? Aspiring kid fucker. Is that even better for you? Because that's what the guy is. He's this real gross old man. And the opening scene for the camp is these kids are running to get to their rooms. And the guy's like, look at all that fresh young meat. And this black kind of Uncle Remy. Guy that just doesn't have a problem with anybody. And I feel like they told him, Can you smile more when you say a line? The Uncle Remus guy is like, Oh, these kids are much too young for you. And he goes, We call them baldies where I'm from. And I'm like, That's fucking gross. But the Uncle Remus guy goes, Huh, you're just kind of gross. And then just walks off. That was a direction choice to be like, I need you to smile more, old black man, because we can't buy that you're an old, wise black man unless you talk with a fake southern accent and smile at everything white people say, regardless of how disturbing it is. So, I mean, Slipway Camp 1, the 1983 movie. I mean, I think it's an interesting movie. Last movie that Mike Kellen did, who Mike Kellen plays the head of the camp, Mel, the older man. Yeah. Last movie, he's a very good character actor, actually. He had a long career before Sleepway Camp. He's also in Just Before Dawn, which is probably one of my favorite. I mean, people would say it's a slasher, but it was around before the term slasher was really the thing. I think Slipway Camp is just a very interesting movie because the, I mean, it's made in 83. The tropes are sort of there at this point. But at the same time, you know, it takes itself weirdly seriously in a way that I don't think you see in the sequels. By the time you get to two and three, it's like we're going pure on farce. It's dark. It's dark comedy. Again, I think the sequels are made for the kind of cat at that time that's going to have a cutoff denim jacket, a Slayer shirt, and does want to laugh at dick and fart jokes and bloodbaths. They don't want to get scared. They want a bloodbath because there's no jump scares. A lot of these movies don't have jump scares. They're not frightening. There's no atmosphere. It's like, give me a bloodbath with a heavy metal soundtrack. And that's what the 80s is for me with horror. Yeah, and I don't know what else we can add about Sleepway Camp 1983. I think it's actually like a pretty well-made independent production for what it is. You know, like Robert Hiltsick put a lot of time and effort into it, and they did what they could on a low budget. Now, what's interesting is he does the direct sequel, right? Return to Sleepway Camp, which ignores Sleepway Camp 2 and 3. I remember when that first came out, actually. It came out on DVD, straight to DVD. And I was in Target the day it came out with my family. And I'm like, we have to get this. And I'm in the Target. We can't find it. And there's some bald dude there with us looking around. He's like, are you looking for it too? I'm like, what? He's like, you know. And I'm like, return to Sleepway Camp. He's like, yeah. And we couldn't find it. And eventually he left. And then this dude that works at Best Buy comes up to us. It was the Best Buy or Target. And he's like, what are you looking for? And I'm like, return to Sleepway Camp. And he's like, I don't know if we have that in yet. I'll check in the back. And he comes back with the DVD. And you were like, oh, no, we had come there for that. I was like, oh, you went there for that. Oh, wow. You have good parents. I went there for that. Yeah. On the day it came out. You know, and most people were disappointed. I actually, I haven't seen Return to Sleepway Camp in years, but I had fun with it. I haven't seen it. So still, it's not on Blu-ray or 4K. I have not seen Return. I knew about, like I said, the sequels that come out in the 80s. And it's not the same, though. Like the 1983 movie is Magic in a Bottle. I don't think anyone knew what they were making. I don't like, you know, I don't know that Felicia Rose, who plays Angela, knew. Of course not. I know that Karen Fields, who played Judy, didn't know. And she has the best line in that movie. Flat as a board and didn't need a screw. A real carpenter's dream. It's the meanest shit I've ever heard. Oh, it's a great line. That's that adults writing kids' language shit, right? Because there's no young person that's going to say that. What's weird is you do kind of feel for Angela a bit in that movie. More than a few. You feel for, okay, this is how I feel. After you know about the reveal, this is a movie for me kind of like, this is going to sound crazy. This is a movie for me kind of like Memento, where I go, you go back and watch it after you know what the ending is. And it's a whole different film because now you know you're watching. This is going to sound bad. And I hope I don't get in trouble for saying this. You're watching a boy living life as a girl and how uncomfortable it is because A, he can't say anything about it. And B, it's scary. Life as a girl is scary because he's not. And all the girls around him are coming of a certain age where they're enjoying the attention they're getting from young men. Again, a man wrote this. So the characteristics. Meanwhile, little Angela is just like, she doesn't know what to do in the boys showing. She doesn't know what to do when boys show. You remember the part where the guy puts his hands over her eyes and he's like, guess who? She's just like, Burt Reynolds. For some reason, I always get a kick out of that. She's dealing with like growing up. She's around these girls who are like coming of age sexually and guys that are coming of age sexually. She doesn't know how to deal with it. Yeah, because she's like, well, I don't, I don't like these guys like that. And I'm in a room with a bunch of hot naked girls. So she does what any 12-year-old boy would do and stares and just stares. Because I'm watching it. I'm like, oh, yeah. I would probably be very frightened and quiet and just stare as well. Right? Then there's like fear. Imagine the fear of the shower because it's like you can't. They like, she can't go in the shower because if she goes in the shower, they're going to see the bing bong. So there's this awkwardness of living in this world where kind of everyone is a predator. And her first interaction with an adult is being trapped in a room with this aspiring kid fucker. Because the other word Achimi is bad, but this is okay to say. Um, and luckily, she's kind of saved last minute by her cousin. Um, and she, of course, gets her come-up-ins on this on this character. But uh, it's a frightening existence for an awkward young girl who doesn't want to be like the rest of them. Maybe you're maturing a little different. Like, I don't in the chat, I'm sure there's got to be at least two women in the chat that have opinions on that. Would you agree that it's played much more straight than the sequels? Oh, fuck yeah, the movie is like I said, there's there's teen comedy hijinks in it a little bit, but I mean, everything is played for laughs in this, like there's so many, like, uh, I mean, she's doing Freddy Krueger clips in the sequels, yeah. The Freddy Krueger hands and the Jason Mask. The by the time that, like, if you watch this movie, it does, it's also one of these movies where there's decent dudes in it. If you watch Friday the 13th and a lot of these other movies, kind of everybody's a piece of shit in this movie, they really want to draw demarcating lines between bad and good people. Yeah, look at Peter, her cousin, or whatever. Like, he's awesome, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right, Ricky, yeah, he he seems like a pretty decent kid, right? He's trying to protect his cousin, he understands what she's going through and is trying his best to incorporate her into the community, but also protect her from harm and ridicule. So, their relationship is actually kind of adorable to watch. Actually, some of the camp counselors in the movie are just decent people that want young people to have a good time. I like Ronnie in the movie. He's a honor guy, right? Yeah, yeah. I like, I like, they bring him back for Return to Sleepboy Camp, and it's the best part of the movie in a lot of ways because he plays like a paranoid nut that's like, oh, it's going to happen again. But yeah, you don't hate everyone in it, you know? Yeah, you can't. They're actually like at the end of the movie, kind of the main counselor, this buff, the most buff Italian stereotype out of New Jersey that's ever existed of a buff Italian stereotype in 1983. That man's shorts were a thing of beauty, by the way. But, you know, he's constantly trying to protect Angela as best he can. And at the very end, he goes, She's a boy. He's the one that has that line. And she doesn't want to harm him because he's a decent guy. What's really sad to me, and this will be the last that we can say on the first one, is there's a young boy. I can't remember the. His name because he's been in a few other movies that people would recognize. There's a young boy that does like her, and he it's almost like they're coming of age at the same point where they're both kind of awkward. And he doesn't approach her in a very predatory way. And she's like, Hey, he just wants to be my friend. Every time he's like, But I like you, she's like, Ah, I don't want to get down like that. And then, you know, I believe she does kill him, right? Yes, yeah, she does. Because I think he doesn't she cheat, he cheats on her. Ready for a podcast that moves you to action?

Did the sequels keep the creepy psychological edge or did it crank up the gore for you, JG? I don't think it cranked up the gore because by 80, so there's a big gap, right? 83 is the first sleepway camp, 88, I believe, is the second one, and then 89 is the third one, right? And by that point, the MPAA is losing their minds. I actually have an uncut copy, I have an uncut copy of Sleepway Camp 3: Teenage Wasteland that is like nine minutes longer. Okay, it's an hour and 20-minute movie, around an hour and 20 minutes, but they cut it to bits. Because the MPAA is just like, oh my God, if you show a knife penetrating someone in a movie, a fake fictional movie, this is the worst thing. You know, and I mean, it's, yeah, it's a different time in a weird way in the 80s. It's, I mean, they're really like, you know, they're going hard on horror movies by 88. So I don't think it was the gore, but there was another aspect you mentioned. I think by 88, in any case, it's just a whole different world, you know. And I think Sleepway Camp 2 and 3 reflect that. I think they're much more. I said the psychological aspect of it where they're trying to. I think the psychological aspects are there in Sleepway Camp 2 and 3. So in Sleepway Camp 2, you have Angela returning to camp. And all Angela really wants in the sequels is to have a good time with good kids at the camp. But the kids always let her down and they're always like assholes within her weird warped moral framework. Except for like one kid that she takes a liking to. And in the second one, that's Molly, who is played by the wonderful Renee Esteves. I love Renee Estevez, as my name shows on this episode. The baby sister of the Estevez brothers. Yes, yeah. She's one of the Estevez Sheen kids. She's Betty Finn in Heathers, if you want to know. Yes, she is. And she looks great in a pair of short shorts in this movie, I gotta say. But she's like the good girl in Sleepway Camp 2. And actually, that's the part I like most about Sleepway Camp 2 is actually the relationship between Angela and Molly. Renee Estevis' character. You know, there's a psychological element. And then, and then in the third one, it's interesting because the third one is like the somber, depressing version of Angela, where Angela it's like it takes place in autumn, and Angela just has flashbacks to the past. And she's just like, why are they always assholes? Why can't there just be good kids that aren't bullies? You know, and it's like sad Angela in the third movie, you know. Either way, she's getting to take out like the bad kids or whatever. That's the whole premise of Sleepway Camp 2 and 3. And I mean, there is sort of a Reaganite sort of element to it. I was going to ask you about that. Can we read Angela in the sequels as a product of Reagan-era conservatism? And I want to expand on that by saying: if Freddy Krueger is the antithesis to Reagan-era conservatism, right? He's the anti-hero of legend. Is Angela then kind of the yin to that yang? I think she's just a prude. No, I mean, I mean, she's kind of like this prude. Sometimes you're like cheering for her because you're like, ah, that kid's an asshole. Like when she takes out Mare. Remember Mare from the second movie? Mary? She's so mean. She makes Renee Estevez cry, which does not make me happy. But yeah, a lot of the kids she takes out in the second one, it's like, oh, they were just having sex and having fun. But she has, it's weird because it's also like, I mean, they very clearly portray her as like having a warped moral vision of the world. I'm not sure you're supposed to cheer for her as much. I think it's just supposed to be farcical. I think she's a farcical version of Reaganite conservatism that is kind of the popular feeling of the country at the time. The cultural sort of culturalism. And these movies are as countercultural as it's going to get. We just don't look at them in the same regard as the 60s counterculture movies for whatever reason. And I don't, I've never really understood that. Maybe because it's easier to market by this point and they're popular in the suburbs, so people don't see it the same way. But they really are fuck your parents. And Angela is the older kid's sister or aunt that tells on you. Right. The wicked witch of the West is they call her in the second movie. She's really shitty. And then part of me, when you watch these movies, you're like, why are you so shitty? Like the little girl in the original one. I don't know if the events of that first movie would lead her to be such a prude. Because if you watch the first movie, she never had fun. Like everything was frightening. Playing sports was frightening. Showering, using the bathroom was frightening. Eating was frightening. Like she was afraid to do anything. Why would she then go to a hospital and come out? Well, now I got to kill people for fucking. Like, it's just again, she's a made-up character by the second. That has nothing to do with the first. They really do exist to me in different universes. Yeah, it's very much a comedy of, I mean, it's comedy poking fun at like moral prudishness. It's also poking fun at a lot of other things, right? Because I mean, and there's points where you kind of cheer for Angela, like when she goes after Mirror or someone that's, you know, kind of a douchebag. But it's, it's the second one's interesting. I actually like the third one more. The third one is better. Yeah. In the third one, she's like all somber and depressed. She's like, God damn, why can't I just find like one camp that has good kids? The first one deals with this thing. And I don't know if you feel the same way where the guy that runs the camp is constantly trying to cover up these murders and quote-unquote accidents, right? Because Angela doesn't kill the aspiring kid banger. She boils the shit out of him with a cauldron of hot water, but he does survive. And the guy that owns the camp is trying to keep all this a secret. By the time you get to the second one, I feel like there's certain characters that don't exist the same way as bad people. The third one, like that, those camp people are hilarious. Right. The woman is doing everything that major corporations are doing to cut costs. And one big thing that we see happening towards the fall of the Cold War that people start caring about is dumping toxic waste, especially after, you know, Three Mile Island and later Chernobyl. So toxic waste becomes a real big thing, especially after the fall. That becomes a huge thing. It's interesting. Sleepway Camp 3 is interesting to me because it, I mean, so the whole premise of Sleepway Camp 3 is the second movie is like, oh, she's going back to this new camp and she's a camp counselor and no one knows who she actually is. And she's just annoyed by these kids not being her ideal vision, right? You know, like they don't conform to her like moral vision of what everything should be in 1988. Whereas the second one's a bit more interesting to me because, uh, or the third one is a bit more interesting to me because it's like, oh, they're reopening the camp after everyone died last year. And it's, and it's an experiment in sharing, right? The camp counselors that run it are like, oh, we're bringing together lower, underprivileged kids from the lower classes. Yeah. And the, the, the upper class kids. We're going to, yeah, it's an experiment in sharing. And everyone is just portrayed as a fucking morally degenerate woman. Everyone, thank you, but everyone is bad. But I don't know if you feel the same way. In the third, you're presented with the bad kids as kind of pieces of shit. And the rich kids are somewhat quiet and a little more reserved. I disagree with that. I think the rich kids are just as morally degenerate. It takes a while. We're going to watch the third one. It takes a while for you to find that out. And it feels like there's like rewrites going on. Okay, we have to make this guy. They say it pretty early on. Like, you have the one girl, the rich country girl, who's like, she's asked early on. She's like, oh, that Tony, he's attractive, isn't she? And she's like, he's Hispanic. Yeah, he's Hispanic. I mean, these people come off, the rich kids come off pretty badly early. I don't know, man. For me, it is. I'll say this. Sleep by Camp 3 is more in line with the director, Michael A. Simpson's other films. So, Michael A. Simpson, Double Helix Films, was his production company. But Michael A. Simpson did a few other movies. I think he's more of a producer now. But outside of Sleepboy Camp 2 and 3, he did a movie called Fast Food with Tracy Lords and Jim Barney, otherwise known as Ernest P. World. And that's a movie, it's a sex comedy farce about, you know, I haven't seen it, but my understanding is it's sort of like Good Burger, where it's like evil fast food company is trying to put the small guy out of business. Gotcha. You know, so there's that anti-corporate thing. And then his other film that's really interesting is this movie called Funland, which I suggest everyone find it. I think you can find it on streaming. But Funland is this movie about this clown. I think his name is like Bruce Berger in the movie. And he works at this amusement park. And then the amusement park gets taken over by these corporate assholes. And they're trying to destroy the park so they can make money or whatever. And, you know, off the insurance. I don't know. I forget the details. But I do remember specifically the final act of the movie where the clown guy loses his mind. Like the whole movie is his slow descent to insane into insanity. It's a black comedy. It's a dark comedy. He slowly loses his mind and eventually he just becomes like a massacring shooter that shoots people in the park. It's a very funny movie because it's basically like a working class guy losing his mind because of corporate America. You know, and Michael A. Simpson, I think, is at his best when he's playing with that social commentary element. It's not like done in a way where it's pandering or it's like trying to beat you over the head, but there's an element of like him playing with class politics. And I think you see that more in three than you do the second one. I think they're trying to play with it. I don't know the limitations of the editors that that's going on with the playing of the class politics because they're played on stereotype. There's a young black man. Well, they're caricatures. Oh, they're super caricatures. Comedy, though. What do you expect? The black dude wasn't funny. There's like nothing funny about him. He's just. You know who the best person is, isn't it? Did you notice Herman was played by Michael J. Pollard? You remember Michael J. Pollard from Bonnie and Clyde? He's the car driver for them. He plays Herman, the camp counselor dude that's trying to bang the rich girl with the that's what movie he was in. I couldn't do it. He's in a bunch of Bonnie Class. He's a great actor. Do you remember the movie Scrooged? Yes. He's the homeless dude that freezes to death. That he's he was in a bunch of TV stuff, but he always plays that same role as this kind of awkward dude. I've heard that that's not far off from who he is in real life. It's gotta be, man. He's he's super, he's he's super awkward. I think I've heard that he really enjoyed that movie, though, because it's like, oh, I get to be around young girls. He plays, yeah, right. He gets to be around these young girls. And what's funny in the original Sleepaway Camp, the guy that owns the camp ends up propositioning one of the camp counselors who actually was a soap opera. She passed away not too long ago. She was a soap opera actress. I wouldn't say star. She was an actress in one of the ABC soap operas in the 70s and 80s. And he propositions her and she's like all about it, which I thought was odd. I was like, this dude looks old for any time frame. And I don't know too many like 17, 18 year old girls are like, I can't wait to fuck pop pop. But she's all excited about, you know, banging this older guy. And of course, he gets it. But the guy you're talking about also is very similar in part three, where he walks up to at the what do you call it when you're coming into something? The podbean, your message amplified.

I can't think of the word right now. But anyway, and kind of almost pulls out a tac. He shows her he's got a Playboy belt buckle and starts wiggling his fucking junk under his pants. And like, damn, dude, these are supposed to be kids. That's kind of gross. No, it's he's he's one of the people that gets his in the third one. You have the lazy other camp counselor who's married to him, who is just the laziest woman on earth. You have she to me is kind of a caricature of corporate America in this moment where we're mad at corporations for doing things like dumping because they're just burying trash. Well, no, no, that's what's interesting is that there's a lot of caricatures in this. I know, I get what you're saying about like the poor kids are really bad, but like the rich kids are also like horrible people. The camp counselors are horrible people. Well, but the rich kids have to get so over the top, right? Like the not the poor kids aren't, but you open the scene where everyone's the introduction to the camp. They're having, you're going to see it in part three. And this black kid has a little boombox because apparently all black people have boomboxes. As a black person that did grow up in this time frame, I didn't know anyone that walked around with one. But let's just say for some reason, all black kids have boom boxes. And he's playing the boombox really loud. And they ask him to turn it off. And he has to do it in this way where he has to give a menacing look. Like, I'm not doing this because you told me to do it. I'm doing this because, okay, fine. The best part of his performance is Angela goes into his tent and is like, I think it's only fair that you clean the fish that we just caught. We spent two hours catching it. And he's like, what? And she's like, you heard me. Stop playing that music so loud. You heard me. And he just pulls out a gun and points it at her. And Pamela Springsteen gets out of the tent and she looks at Bobby, the annoying politician kid, wannabe politician kid, and says, Bobby, you clean the fish. It's a beautiful, you know, Pamela. I actually think Pamela Springsteen is better in the second movie or in the third movie than she is. Like, she's much more comfortable. Comfortable. I was going to say the same. Yeah, and it's very comedic to her. She to me, she gets it by the third one. Even if they're filmed back to back, she gets it in the third one. Like, look, we're doing this. I think there was a one weekend difference between the second and third movie. I get what you're saying about everyone's a caricature in it, but I think that's true of the rich kids too. The rich country girl, I cheer every time she dies in it. She's just like, and you're a nasty, mean bigot. Oh, yeah. She's she's horrible. She says something about an n-word. Yeah. Yeah, she does drop an N-bomb in it. She's because he's an n-word or something like that. Like, she says something pretty fucking horrible. But me and JG were talking about this beforehand. I was like, in all fairness, that dude did pull out a knife. And if it wasn't for the focus, I don't think you're supposed to take it seriously either with the rich kids or the underprivileged kids, right? Like, it's they're they're both caricatures, you know. I also expect for the Asian woman. Yeah, the Asian woman. Well, that's that's uh, what's her that's Frannie from Night of the Demons. Another movie that we have to cover on the show. Great, great little, you know, horror flick. But uh, I actually liked her in this. She wasn't that bad. She didn't deserve it. You know who else I love? I love getting, you know, his in that movie is Haynes Brooke, who plays Bobby. Is he the guy that likes the bondage dude? He likes being tied up. Yeah. He, the first thing he says to Angela is, so you're one of the underprivileged. She just looks at him like, what the is wrong? And his, but his reveal is interesting because I don't think it works. Because either you don't understand people or you're a piece of shit. And I don't think you can be both. And he's this person that's like, oh, you guys are underprivileged. I just don't, I just don't get how you people are. And I don't understand people. And I'm going to say very mean. He's a stupid sheltered asshole. No one is that sheltered. But you're still in a stronger. Oh, yeah, but it's it's a it's it's an elevated version of reality, so everyone is just a farcical version of a real person. Yeah, that's that's sometimes this is like a bridge too far. It's like just make him it wasn't for me, I laugh my ass off. I'd rather you just make him uh a kind of John Hughes character, right? Uh, like a James Spader John Hughes character, but maybe that's just too much because that guy has to be cool to a certain extent. And this guy isn't cool at all, he's just quote-unquote rich. And uh, he's a rich spoiler brat. Yeah, what does he say to her brother? I thought you uh, you underprivileged people. Uh, I thought your type was into that. You were giving us into that if you're a landlord in Oregon or Washington, you've been through enough rent control, endless rules, government overreach. Can you even sell your investment property or multifamily property without just giving it away? Hey, it's Lars. You can if you call my friend and trusted real estate expert Nick Shivers at Keller Williams Realty. With Nick's My Rocket Listing Program, you can sell it instantly, even with the tenants in place. Too good to be true? Nope, it's simple. Go to nickshivers.com to get your investment property or multi-family property sold guaranteed. You know, the best, the best thing about three. See, you know what's interesting about three? I've made this argument before. I think by the time you get to like 1989, horror movies just are like so worn out from like Morning in America BS that they just become like really angry and pissed off in like weird ways that you don't see before that. Like late 80s horror is much weirder than people realize. Like, early 80s horror is very mean-spirited, and late 80s horror gets very mean-spirited. So, what I'm going to get at here is: at the end of Sleepway Camp 3, spoilers, spoil it all. Tony and the main girl, whose name I forget, I think it was Cindy, anyways. They survived the night, and he's just like, I want to move to Idaho or Ohio, wherever you live. And she's like, Well, I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend. And it's like, it's just the funniest thing imaginable. This is such a mean-spirited way to end off their story. And you see it. What's interesting is you see that in Nightmare on Elm Street 5 the same year. That's a very mean-spirited movie. That's a movie dealing with like bulimia and then, like, you know, like parents abusing their children by making them be supermodels. It's a very mean-spirited, dark gothic movie. Halloween 5 is even more mean-spirited, where they like they openly show a scene of two kids having sex in a barn and they pull out the condom and they're like, We have to have safe sex, and they get killed anyways. Yeah, that's that's the thing about the trope, JG. That I agree with you. This movie does it in the two and three. In two, the girl has sex with a dude without a condom, and she goes, You don't have AIDS, do you? Yeah. And in three, uh, the couple that actually likes each other, they have the condom, yeah. Yeah, she goes, If you want to make love to me, you have to wear one of these. Well, the point I was making with five is Halloween five is that literally, even the condom doesn't save you, right? Even like a little 10-year-old girl is in danger, and you think she's actually going to die in a laundry shoot, right? Like, late 80s horror is like very mean-spirited, and I think even like the child's play movies are extremely mean-spirited compared to like mid-80s horror because you're gonna torture children, child. It's like there's a there's like a weird thing, I think it's the burnout from the Morning in America shit. And in a way, I think that Sleepway Camp 2 and 3 are like an embodiment of that, especially 3. Because I think they're punk rock, I think they're punk rock movies. I do. Again, I feel like when you watch 2 and 3, you're watching to JG's point, you're watching the next phase of an overabundance of horror movies that we're no longer caring about atmosphere. The whodunit is gone. This is all about can we make the killer talkative, funny, and give you a sequel. And when we think about all the sequel movies, after Freddy, everyone talks. No one talks beforehand. No one's talking. Jason Voorhees didn't talk. What's the dude's name in Texas Chainsaw? I can't even think. Leatherface. Leatherface. Face didn't talk. It doesn't have a name. Right. Of course, Michael Myers doesn't talk. And they don't have backstories. There's no backstory. Exposition Smission. It's like we're trying to. The original ones are trying to make a movie that's going to make you uncomfortable. By the time you get to like 85, we don't care about making you uncomfortable. You want to see Blood and Guts. We're going to give you Blood and Guts. We're going to give you gore to a really cool soundtrack by a thrash metal band, which is even crazier when you think about it because this is not even pop. What's the one in Anvil do one of the songs in Sleepway Camp 2 or 3? Did Anvil? Yeah. Oh, I don't know. I'd have to look it up. Yeah, Drea says Pinhead said plenty. Those are different movies. Those are Clive Barker movies. Yeah, Pinhead isn't like the main villain of Hellraiser. No. They're not the villains. By the time you get to the third, they become villains. That's why I hate Hellraiser 3. Yeah, Hellraiser 2, Hellraiser 1 and 2. The villains are the humans. Yeah. Someone says Jennifer Aniston was in the first leprechaun. Like we said, a lot of big actors get their break. Johnny Depp is in Nightmare on Elm Street, the original. Kevin Bacon is in the original Friday the 13th. I think that's his first big role. Demi Moore, her first movie is In Seminoids. No. No, it's Parasite. Parasite. That's what's forgetting Charles Dan from Full Moon. Yeah. So. Renee Zellwiger, Texas Chainsaw 4. Next Generation. Matthew McConaughey is in that as well. Yes. Yeah. Sleepway Camp 2 and 3, though. It's... I don't know. The third one gets me because I just... It's just a very funny movie. Yeah. The second one's a comedy, too. A very dark comedy, but it's almost like they fully embraced it by the third movie. Which I appreciate. Again, I agree with you wholeheartedly that the third movie, it just moves better. Yeah. Even though the character. The second one just sort of ends, right? It doesn't feel like there's a climax, but then there's that like, it's almost like an epilogue almost. You know? Well, as we're, as we're approaching the... I'm sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry. It just feels kind of like in a weird way, it feels just joined at the second one. What actually makes a horror sequel better? The original? Better than the original? Story, shock, or just more kills? Well, with Sleepway Camp, I would say it's like, oh, we can't really capture the magic of the original. Let's just make a comedy. I'm not joking. I think Michael A. Simpson was very smart because I think he looked at it and said, we can't do the original. I'm good at doing like really, really dark comedy. Like I said, Funland is a very dark comedy. Like, that's, that's like, you know, if you like anti-corporate movies, like, Funland is a great movie. It's a great little low-budget movie. And he knew, like, I just want to make a sort of countercultured comedy movie that's a farcical version of the first. And I think that's why Sleepway Camp 2 and 3 works so well. I think that's why I was telling you beforehand, these movies, Sleepway Camp 2 and 3 just got 4K releases from Shout Factory. I mean, there's people that really love these movies. And the reason is because they do something different than the original. They're completely different. You know, in a weird way, I actually think a lot of people would have preferred Pamela Springsteen to return in Sleepway Camp 4 or whatever. The official, because there was a Sleepway Camp 4 that was done in the 90s, but it wasn't finished. It was called The Survivor. And then we got Return to Sleepway Camp. In some ways, I think people would have preferred the Pamela return. I mean, I love Felissa Rose, and I love that she came back to Return to Sleepway Camp, but, you know, two and three have like a real cult following that I think is overlooked at times. Yeah, I mean, I also think, is it two? I think two is where they make fun of Jason and Freddie, right? Where she literally has the mask on and kills someone with a Freddy glove. Yeah, it's one of the most comedic moments, I would say. That and the scenes with the shit sisters or the shilt sister. They call them the shit sisters. Also, again, camp counselor short length in these movies is, I think, superb. Which camp counselors? All the camp counselors have great shorts. That's true. I love how in the set, I love the interactions. See, what's weird is like, I actually think these movies work because of the stuff in between the kills. I really do think that because, like. The interactions between the camp counselor TC and Angela in the second movie, half of the movie is devoted to that, right? He's just like, he's trying to be nice to her, and she's this cold person. He's like, well, I don't know what, I don't know what the hell to do. Why can't she get her to like open up to me? Yeah, because he's a decent guy. And I think they're trying to play on that decent guy thing from the original one. There's a lot of comedy gleaned from that. Like it's the it's sort of like Motor and Scully, right? Oh, interesting. People remember the X-Files for the monsters, but I remember it because to me, the X-Files was at its best when it was playing with the characters, right? Like the, I told that to Mitch Pelegi. I met Mitch Pelleggi uh earlier this year at a convention. I said, I think the reason the X-Files works is the interaction between you, Scully, and Motor. You know, like people don't think about it that way because they think, oh, it's always the monster that makes it, but really, it's the human interactions that make the rest of the picture. You know, I think that's true with Sleepway Camp 2 and 3 in a weird way because I think a lot of the comedy derives from the interactions. And Angela is so like off-kilter and weird and awkward. You know, there's a lot of humor derived from that because you know what she is, but no one else does. No one knows. And it makes for a lot of good, like, oh, that's funny, you know, type moments. And I think that's why the films work. They know what they are. They're farces. Well, are you ready to watch part three? I will watch part three. Yes. I lied to everyone and said we were going to watch part two, but I think we should watch part three. I think we should watch part three. I mean, I say that with a broken heart because I have a crush on Renee Esteves. Well, what do you want to watch part two? I actually let's watch part three. Okay. You heard it from JG. He said, We're watching part three. Watch part two on your own time. Renee Estevez looks great in a pair of short shorts. Watch bot two on your own time. Hey, hey, what one thing three is actually I kind of prefer three for another reason that will get me canceled. It's a lot sleazier, you know. Like I said, you got the leopard print panties at the opening. Opens up with a lot more boobs in it. You know, Michael J. Pollard being a sleaze ball. Unnecessary death is another funny thing in the movie. Like, you have to remember that it is being played for jokes because when they kill the female cam counselor lady by burying her in the trash, what's funny is like she could have got out, she wasn't tied, she just had a blindfold on. She could have just like got out. I was watching that as we were starting. She's covered in the dirt, she wasn't even covered in dirt yet. She could have just got out. She just too lazy, though. That's the point. She could have taken the blindfold off. She didn't have anything on her hands. I was like, you could have got, I was cracking the up because that to me is an 80s movie death in a nutshell. And I really think that was done on purpose to make fun of the way people die in these movies. It's so preventable. You know, even in the original Sleepaway Camp, when her sister and dad die, it's like they could have moved. It took like nine years for them. Frank and Hooker plays on that. Yeah, Frank, Kennedy Lauder. I think that Frank and Hooker write it. Yeah, right. The joke about how did your girlfriend die in a horrible lawnmower accident? It's like she could have moved. It's crazy that Sleepboy Camp 3 for real. It's crazy. Like, there's so many boobies in it. There's a lot. There's much more than in the second one. They just had like boobs. You're going to see him constantly, too. You know why else? By the way, before we finish out, you know why else I think these two movies work? Because they're very regional films. I think they were both filmed in Atlanta. You know, so it's not like you're not seeing the usual same faces from Hollywood. You know, you're seeing people like Fran from Franny from Night of the Demons. You know, you get to see people that you don't usually see. And it feels very regional in a way that like that's to me, that's very charming. You know, the sort of regional non-LA sort of production that you're seeing. So the accents are so thick in the first few. That's true. They're just so, and I kind of love it. What did you think about the news broadcaster, by the way, in the third one? Where can I get some Coke, kid? You're one of these underprivileged kids. You know where I get some Coke? I was cracking up that she had a You know what's messed up? I've known news broadcasters that are like that. Look, the cocaine is one thing. It's 1988, right? That's the thing that I thought was crazy is like, how did this bitch get a fucking Lamborghini? You're just a local news chick. Like, geez, what are you insider trading? Fuck are you doing to get the Lamborghini? I was cracking the hell up. And, and, The massive snort she took of her bindle, her massive bindle of cocaine. Yes. That was just Comet. Man, this poor kid's cocaine sure is clean smelling. You never know what people are going to mix in it. That's why you don't take drugs from strangers. There you go. JG Michael spoken like a true. I think that was Angela's actual line in the movie. I love how they actually follow up from the second to the third movie. You know, the one camp's counselor is the dad from the whose son died in the second one. They actually did try to do some world building. Someone says she made the story of Don Henley having sex with a minor disappear. That's how she got the Lambo. She just has a Lamborghini for no reason. You're like, she's just the local newscaster. You're like, Jesus Christ. So, so, Jason, I know we're going to do the watch-along of the third movie, but what's coming down the pike for this show? This little shindig that we're doing. There's so many movies and things in general that I want to cover in just the realm of low culture in general. I kind of felt like a jerk because you hooked me up with Ross Bennis and him and I are doing a show tomorrow, actually, about Howard Stern. And in hindsight, I was like, that probably could have been a three of us show since Howard Stern really does exist in this low culture world before he gets massive amounts of money to go to satellite radio. Um, I don't know how you feel about Stern. I'm trying to get uh Monique on from uh the Radio Gunk podcast. Do you know Radio Gunk or no? They're they're a podcast that has been exposing Stern for like the past, I don't know, five, ten years or whatever. They're former fans that got annoyed with Stern, but they have insiders, so they it's easy to get annoyed with him. He's kind of a shitty dude and made a show around. I think Howard Stern's DNA is all over a lot of bigger shows on the internet because being mean kind of became the thing. There is one difference, you know, why Stern got away with it in ways that you couldn't get away with it now. Is uh he's Jewish, no, no, but Stern is a gangly, self-deprecating like he hates himself. You listen to this, I'm not a fan of 90s, 2000s Howard Stern, but he sort of says, like, I also am a loser and my penis is small and I hate myself, yeah, which it takes the edge off. That's why I think people liked him back then. I'm not trying to defend the dude, like, I think he's an asshole. I mean, he's the I mean, I think he's the recent Donna Plato's dead, you know, Dana Plato. So, I think he played a role. I wouldn't go that far, but I think he played a major role. I think he screens the calls, dude, he knew what they were gonna say. He played a role, yeah, he played a major role. Um, but I do think he's different in that. Uh, she was on the ledge and he pushed. How about a lot of edgelord comics today don't self-deprecate in the way that he did. I think that's what took the edge off for a lot of Stern's stuff. You know, let's before we go, I do want to ask you about this because I think this is kind of important and I think it plays into what we talk about on this show. Recently, Mark Maron has been on the podcast tour to promote his new Netflix special, where some people are calling it a return to woke or a want to return to woke. And I don't know if that's necessarily what you could say about someone like Mark Maron. I look at Mark Maron like I look at David Cross, like I look at Sam Cedar, like I look at Bill Burr, because a lot of those guys are from the same era of comedy where they're a little smarter. Um, they are funny. I think they're free speech absolutists. Um, they definitely are reading the newspaper and understand politics in a way maybe comedians of an earlier generation didn't. Um, so I don't think Mark Marin wants to make a return to woke. I don't, I, I, I, listen, you listen to Doug Stanhope at all. I did stay stanhope is my be-all end-all for comedians, like because I'm a messed up, dark, horrible person. So, Stanhope, uh, I, I really. Relate to him on a visceral level. But, you know, even Stanhope is sort of, it's not that Stanhope is like woke. It's that he's anti-anti-woke. I keep telling people that. I'm not even woke. I'm just anti-anti-woke at this point. And I think that's where a lot of comedians are at. Just anti-anti-woke because it's like, you know, I can complain about movies and comedy specials that lean too much into like beating an idea over my head, but the right wing does the same thing. And it's, I mean, it's obnoxious. You know, I did you see the recent short film that came out last night, the new official Jason Voorhees short film, Sweet Revenge. No commercial for Hard Cider. But it was decent. You know, I didn't like it at first, but then I saw all the people complaining about it in the chat. And people are complaining about it in the Angry Orchard chat saying, well, they went woke. They went woke. How did they go woke? Oh, it's because they had an interracial couple in the movie, in this short film that Mike P. Nelson, who does a lot of horror stuff, did. But I'm thinking to myself, what is wrong with you? Like, you're mad that there's an interracial couple in a movie in 2025. You're worse than the people you call woke. Like, woke doesn't even really exist anymore. Like, no, there are these, do you? But do you think that there's these demarcating lines that are drawn now, right? To the point where a guy like Mark Marin, who again, these people come from the school of George Carlin, who is the epitome of anti-woke. George Carlin has a lot of right-wing positions, um, for people don't realize for some reason. And Stanhope's like a civil libertarian, you know. I think he's moved away from libertarianism in recent years, but I haven't seen him say anything in like 20 years. Not that I say he has, I just haven't really, I don't watch a lot of comedy. I think they're just tired of people telling them what the what the hell to do, which is it feels like it's a different world, though. It's like we didn't care unless people really crossed the line, and none of these people are crossing a line on either side. Neither side is very edgy, right? You know, um, it's just where do I fit in my safe zone, right? Stanhope said something interesting. He said that he thinks there can be like comedy for different types of people. He's like, I'm fine with the woke comics, they're just not gonna come to my show. You know, they can have the we can have their woke comedy section, and then I can have my fucked up for dark, humorous, screwed up people section of comedy that come to see me, you know, and that's kind of what's happening. Like, everyone's just cordoned off into their stupid little, you know, bubbles, yeah. So, I mean, I don't see Mark Marin and these people as returning to woke. I don't, I mean, I don't know what woke means anymore. I know Freddy DeBoer would get annoyed if I said that. You know what woke means. I love Freddy, but it's like, I just don't see this as an issue anymore. And I think the culture war is increasingly stupid and tiresome. You know, I mean, it's like if I mean, it's the same with Sleepway Camp. I know people that will complain and say, Oh, you couldn't make a movie like Sleepway Camp today. And I know people that say, Oh, if you're heterosexual, you shouldn't like Sleepway Camp. And for the most part, anyone who likes horror movies doesn't think about this. They don't care. Like, it's kind of just these voices in the wind that, you know, want to garner attention. I don't, you know, I mean, Sleepway Camp is still on streaming services. It's not the end of the world. I don't think they've canceled it. No, I trying to make everything so overly political, I think, is problematic as well. When you watch these movies, if you think that there's a statement the director's trying to make, oof, you're, I don't know what you're saying. I disagree with you on that in so much. People say to me, oh, I hate how movies have deeper meanings. I don't know what deeper meanings means because literally every movie and story that has been told since the beginning of time is born out of a social and historical context. The people that make movies or tell stories, they're embedded within society. So no matter what they do, their stories they tell are going to reflect society. To me, it's not like a deep meaning thing. It's just every, I mean, any horror story, for example, will reflect the anxieties of the era or that the director is thinking about or the writer is thinking about. Every film has meaning, even the most like dumb, stupid films. So I mean, what is the meaning in Sleep Away Camp? I don't think there's a, what I'm trying to say. To say, is I don't think this person was trying to indict no, I don't think that, well, yeah, but meaning trans people, for example, yeah, meaning is different from like beating you over the head with like some type of uh quote-unquote message. Yeah, I mean, the idea that sleepway camp doesn't reflect the fears of its time, I think, is ridiculous. They do what are the fears, though, that it's reflecting the original being away from family, being alone at the sleepway camp, your uh young kids, sexually like active. Bad things can happen when they're away from the parents. I don't know for me, it's more it's not like it's a deep thing, I'm saying like a movie can't exist without having some type of social context. Wouldn't you agree with that? If there's anything that's scary about that movie, again, I think it's knowing you're hiding something and what it's like to be a young girl that hasn't developed like I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be surprised if the writer said, Oh, I had a daughter that was 12, went to camp, yeah, and all her friends were 12 and 13, and they got boobs, and she didn't. And this is the way I thought to make this movie scary about what it was like for my 12-year-old daughter. I'm not saying that, like, they're trying to like be socially conscious, but what I'm saying is every movie is quote unquote socially conscious in a broad sense. And they movies and stories aren't born in vacuums, so they're always saying something like it can be in the most minute, stupid way possible, but they're always reflecting society back on us. Every film, I don't think there's a film that doesn't do that in some way, they always reflect back at you, you know, because these people that write the stories and tell the stories they exist within a society, so they're going to reflect things back from society, the society they write within. You're going to pull it from somewhere, but sometimes I don't think the message. No, I think it can be overanalyzed. I don't think there's necessarily like a super message. You know, it's like John Carpenter, right? Like, I think John Carpenter, well, better example, Toby Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, right? I don't think there's a conscious effort to reflect on the era of Vietnam and the way in which small businesses are going out of business. But I mean, it's a movie that reflects economic anxieties and the anxieties of the period. It's just not like it's not beating you over the head. You see what I mean? Yeah. But it's, I mean, it does exist within a social and historical context. That's why I don't like people that say that there should be no academic study of these films. There's great academic study of these films by people like Troy Howarth and many, many others who are doing, you know, they do the audio commentaries movies for these movies. And people say it gets too deep, though, where all I don't think it does. I don't think it always does. You don't think it gets too deep where all of a sudden women are killed because they have sex and it's like, well, they're killed because it's a plot device. That's the that's the that's the oversimplification people do of people like Carol Clover. Carol Clover wrote Men, Women, and Chainsaws, which was an academic treatise on horror films, including Slashers. But, you know, she was also a defender of Ice Spit on Your Grave. And I know you have criticisms of that movie, but you'd be surprised she was very like open to discussing these films. You know, you can find things in them that you may see as like misogynistic, but then you can also find, as Carol Clover would point out, aspects that force you to identify with a female character. She would point both things out. It's not an indictment of the film, but these films do reflect the society they're born out of, both for good and ill, and it's not a big deal. I think it's great that there's people like Troy Howard and I'm blanking on other names, but there's a lot of people doing audio commentaries and historical archival work and academic work on these films. And it's necessary because the only thing we see nowadays is how many essays do we need on something like Citizen Kane? I had someone on who wrote a book about Cannibal Holocaust. They said, how many books do we need on Citizen Kane? I want to do a book on Cannibal Holocaust and look at how it, how it plays with postmodernism and how it plays with tropes about the media. And I think it's perfectly fine to do academic analysis of cult movies and movies that are made on lower budgets because every movie, every movie. Cannibal Holocaust. We could do a whole episode on that as well. I mean, it would probably upset people, but I mean, if you're getting upset at that, it's okay, though. It's okay, though, that Disney movie where they force the Lemmings to jump off the cliff. No one ever talks about that, but they. Mad about Cannibal Holocaust. That's all I'll say. Do you know the movie I'm talking about? There was a documentary Disney made in the 70s where they made it look like these lemmings were committing suicide, but that's actually fake. They actually ran the lemmings off the cliff. But I bring that up because there's certain movies that people think are worthy of academic analysis and others that aren't. I don't think that's true. I think any movie can be analyzed academically, including Sleep Boy Camp 2 and 3. If you want to do that, then fine. It's probably more interesting than doing Citizen Kane for the 500th time. Now, if you're going to go about and be like, oh, well, this is the only meaning you can derive from these movies, then I think you're probably crazy. But, you know, I think there's a way to talk about these films in a way that contextualizes them historically and socially and situates them in the era they were made in in a way that's interesting. I don't know if you agree with that, but I get your point. Yeah, I think the show is trying to do that, right? The show is trying to do that. Yeah. But, you know, I don't get too deep in the weeds because I understand that when they were making the movie, it was like, we need more tits. No doubt. I mean, we shouldn't lose sight. These are commercial products. I agree with you on that. You know, I'm just saying, and that's that's me. I think that's where I come from. It's like, look, these are commercial products. And sometimes people get a little too in the weeds for commercial products. I think that the opposite is true, too. Where someone like Troy Howarth or I think Eugenio or Coley, they do a lot of audio commentaries. I know them personally. They do a lot of audio commentaries for these films. And I think people assume, like, oh, well, you're not having fun with it because you're analyzing the film and the context it was made in. And I don't think that's true. I think you can analyze the film and also say, well, this was a commercial product made for commercial reasons. You know, I mean, people analyze the movie Predator, right? I mean, Predator is literally a movie where all these macho dudes get beaten down by something that is greater than physically. Yeah, well, they lose. It's Arnold Schwarzenegger eventually wins because instead of relying on his brawn, he relies on his brains, you know, and that does flip the action hero trope on its head. And people can say, well, you're overanalyzing it, but I don't think it's overanalyzing. I think it's just an interesting observation to make, and there's nothing wrong with that. I think you can do that with a lot of horror films, too. And, you know, a lot of the people who do academic work on this stuff are very insightful people. They're not saying you can't just enjoy the film for what it is, but they're saying here's another way to look at it. And I think that's a good thing. I mean, one movie I think that doesn't get enough academic study or correct is like Serpent in the Rainbow, for example. I don't know if you agree with that. I know, I know Pascal hates that movie. Yeah, it's fair, right? The man that wrote the original book, who can't go back to Haiti, you know, because of that movie. The movie is kind of interesting, though, because the movie implies that there's like a pharma element to it, and you don't see that as much in the book. No, because he's not trying to, you know, kind of play on those tropes. The whole reason for the book is to eliminate what the movie ends up making. Right. So let's. Yeah, there's a lot you can do with these films. That's all I'm saying. I hope people aren't offended. I'm not trying to take away your fun. If you just want to watch the sleep away camp movies and be like, I want to turn my brain off, fine. There's nothing wrong with that. But I also do, I really do get annoyed when people are like, oh, we can't have any like in-depth analysis because that means that you're overanalyzing it. And I don't think it has to be either or. Well, again, like I said, isn't this show to overanalyze exactly Mary Lou overanalysis is good at times because I do think there is something to be said about the moment some of these movies are made and what they say about the time that we're living in. Have you seen weapons yet? Nope. That's the new Zach Kreger movie. You know, Zach Kreger, it's funny. Everyone's saying, oh, he just became this big director, Tudor Barbarian, and weapons. And I'm like, dude, he co-founded Whitest Kids You Know with Trevor Moore. But all these people are saying to me, Oh, don't analyze the film. Don't analyze the fact that there's a sort of boomer-generational divide thing going on because that's reading too much into it. I was like, No, it's really not. Like, it reflects the times we live in, the movie. I was like, I don't like the gatekeeping where it's like, oh, you can't talk about this film intellectually. But I'll shut up now. I'm sorry. I had to go on a rant. So mad you thought I was saying something that I wasn't saying. Look at you. You're racing. No, I don't think you're. Yeah. Let me know what you're. I'm just kidding. You're not. You are not like any of the characters. I'm joking. Please don't take me seriously when I say that. Let's go watch this movie. If you are a patron or a paid YouTube subscriber, the link is already up. It's going to be fun. There's going to be boobs. JG is going to tell me to stop to give you trivia. He knows more about these movies because he does something I'm very jealous of, extremely jealous of. He goes to conventions, he meets these people, he has conversations with them, and he finds out in-depth details about productions from the writers. I've only been to one horror convention, and it was so much fun. So, the fact that this guy goes to them all the time. I don't go to them all the time. I don't have that dude. Stop. Don't play it down. It's okay. It's cool. So don't enjoy your dumb movie, nerds. That was funny. Okay, let's go watch this movie. Thank you guys for joining us. Tomorrow night, I will be back with Ross Bennis, author of 1999, The Year in Low Culture. We're going to take a look at the career of Howard Stern. Are you going to jump on that one too, JG? What time are you doing it? Same, same bad time. Okay, I may be able to make it. Okay, you got parties. I know. I know. You actually have a life, friends. Thank you guys. Send me a link. Of course.
