[00:00] There's this product called Hedra, which
[00:02] is I think the best way to take a still
[00:04] frame and add custom audio to it. So
[00:06] create a video that has sort of animated
[00:08] from the still frame and includes the
[00:10] audio with the right lip sync. Nirvana
[00:13] did a really famous New York City
[00:14] unplugged concert in '93. So there's
[00:17] video of them playing in the way that
[00:19] they would and audio the way that they
[00:20] would on Tiny Desk. So that is right
[00:22] here. So I go to audition and I take
[00:25] this video and I just drop it in. We're
[00:27] going to take 15 seconds. Okay. So this
[00:29] command is going to take that audio file
[00:31] we saved of the first 15 seconds of this
[00:34] concert and it's going to extract the
[00:36] vocals from the instrumentation. So this
[00:39] will be Kurt Cobain singing come as you
[00:41] are a capella which is as far as I know
[00:43] has never happened. Upload an image.
[00:45] Let's use this. Upload audio and then we
[00:48] just say man singing
[00:52] tiny desk. All right let's see how this
[00:54] turned out. Come as you are.
[01:00] >> It's very good.
