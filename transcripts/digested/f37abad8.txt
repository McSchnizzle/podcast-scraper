Greetings, I'm your host, Jason Miles, and welcome to another episode of this is Revolution Podcast for all the returning listeners, subscribers, and of course, our very valued patrons. Thank you so much for coming back. For those new to the channel, thank you for taking a moment to check us out. If you did what we're doing, please hit like and, of course, subscribe. It is a passive gesture that goes a long way. I know you guys are saying, hey, that are watching the show. If you're listening to the show, the music sounds the same. But the intro is different because we got tired of having all of the issues with YouTube over the past few months with our introduction, having to pixelate certain things. So the Quintern did this for us. One of the last few solids he's doing as he gets ready to go get his master. So shout out to Quinn. Everybody, give Quinn a good shout out. Also, thank you for everyone that joined us for not only our show last night with Professor Alexander Herbert on political economy, Milton Friedman, and the Chicago School, but also for the birthday movie night. It was fun, and y'all are awesome. Before I start the show's preamble, just a quick reminder that this is listener-supported programming here on TIR. And if you are enjoying what you see here, think about becoming a patron for as little as $3 a month or $30 for the year. You can make sure TIR can continue to be the land of left misfits and badassery. Also, by becoming a patron or YouTube subscriber, you can join us for Movie Night in the champagne room where we'll be going to after the main show tonight. So, let's get down to the topic at hand. Let's talk about some cheery stuff like monopoly in the carceral state. Today, we're exposing a story few hear about, but that touches millions of lives. The privatized telecom companies that hold virtual monopolies over prison calls and digital communication. We're zeroing in on Securist Technologies, the nation's biggest player, now teetering on the brink of bankruptcy under more than $1 billion in debt, thanks to mounting pressure from regulators and activists. For decades, Securis and its rival Via Path have controlled roughly 80 to 90 percent of the U.S. prison communications market. Exploited Captive users and their families charging exorbitant rates. A 15-minute phone call costs as much as $8.25 and video calls up to $15. In many cases, these telecom giants even paid prisons to take their contract, creating perverse incentives for maximum pricing. In the past two years, a wave of activism and legal reforms has disrupted this status quo. The FCC slashed rate caps down to as little as $0.06 per minute for audio and introduced new caps for video and outlawed kickbacks to correctional facilities. In response, private equity owners saw the bottom fallout. Securist defaulted on $1.3 billion of debt with creditors urging a sale or bankruptcy. But as the telecom giants feel the squeeze on call charges, they pivot to monetizing ancillary services like tablets, music, email, and video in prisons, often selling them at inflated prices beyond regulatory control. Today, we're asking: how did Securists and Via Path build this near duopoly on prison communications? What role did activists, families, and regulators play in breaking it? And what happens next? Will privatized telecom go bankrupt or evolve into even more evasive services behind bars? Stay tuned as we unpack the unraveling of a prison telecom empire: how it hurt incarcerated people, their loved ones, and whether real disruption can stick. To have that conversation with me, I think she's having some difficulties, technically, all of a sudden, is a returning guest on the show. Please welcome activist Jessica San Luis. Jessica, can you hear me? Oh no. Oh, there you go. Can you hear me? Hello. Hello, Jessica. Can you hear me? Annie, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie? Jessica, can you hear me? Oh no. I think she's been. Oh, no. I think she's having some difficulties. It's very hot in the Bay Area where she is located. And as what happened with Pascal a few years ago, it does mess up the Wi-Fi. Damn it! Dr. Claus says, I thought the deep state got her. I wish that would explain a lot more. We were literally talking and joking right before we came on. Everything was fine. And then bam! Coconut says, I think Jessica is being beamed up. It would be easier if she was here and we could do the show in person. But I don't think that's going to happen. Oh no. That sucks because you get all ready and then you do the intro and then all of a sudden, it's like, bam, your guest disappears into the ether of bad Wi-Fi. Uh, I wish I knew a lot about prisons, other than people are there, but I don't really know that much. And I'm not going to tell you the conversation we were having off air about prisons. Um, quickly says, Upgrade the IHOP connection. Oh no, oh man, this sucks. I'm not, I'm not really happy right now. I don't, I don't even, I don't know where she went. Um, she disappeared of all the things that I've had happen to a guest, not showing up is what frustrates me the most. Technical difficulties are technical, though. You can't really get mad at someone for that, and I'm not mad, it's just so frustrating. But the best technical difficulties are Dr. Jack Rasmus. That man's camera has a mind of its own, and he gets on a roll and starts talking, and then his camera gets on a roll. So she says she's just a message me, so I believe she's trying to get back in. So. I wish I had hold music that I could play and have a will be right back thing. I don't. Yeah, Koshluk knows his pain and unpanish. Dr. Jack's camera loyal. I think his camera is loyal. It's just not good. And those things are different. All right, Jessica, can you hear me? Can you hear or see me? Can you see, hear me? Can you coconut says sing and twerk? Uh no, because the only way for me to be able to do that would be for me to stand on a chair. And I'm, I just turned 48, and standing on a chair is like bungee jumping for me right now. Oh no, Jessica, you're frozen in the state of frozen. Can you hear me? It says entertain us. Oh, maybe she's there. Jessica, can you hear me now? You can't hear me? Jessica. You can't. You can't hear me. God damn it. Okay, can you hear me now? You're extremely pixelated. Can you hear me? Now we can. Okay. But you're kind of. Yeah, all of a sudden your connection got really bad. Someone says, Jessica, blink twice if you need help. I'm on the show. I don't need. Oh, well, it looks like she can't do it. She's having insane internet issues. Oh, that's frustrating. That wasn't what I planned for the day. Before I turn this off, you guys got any funny things to tell me? Any questions? Anything? Anything to ask before I turn this off? Cry a little bit because I've wasted an entire day. Anything Arlo says, I think the CIA is just vetting the guest. I wish it was that easy. She claims she's trying to come back. Nobody can. You know what's funny when that happens and people try to tell jokes. They always try to tell, like, don't tell a joke. I want to know what's going on. Thank you, Coconut, for saying happy birthday. I appreciate that. Kushluk was fighting with one of our guests on the internet, and I was privy to a little bit of it. Is her connection cooked to the doctor? I don't know. I think she's got a dial-up connection. Do okay, now I can see it. Okay, is that better? Yeah, I can hear you and you're talking and everything. I'm so sorry. Okay. No, it's just be real still. I don't know if that affects the internet. Maybe the move. Okay. No, it's still weird. Can you hear me though? I can hear you most of the time. Okay. Well, you sound like all my other exes. Can you tell us a little bit about the 2024 Martha Wright-Reed Act and how that affects what we're talking about? So the Martha Wright-Reed Act was passed primarily to give incarcerated individuals more access to communications, more access to the community. It was supposed to be kind of a supportive measure, particularly to allow them to interact with the outside world with the idea that rehabilitation is the key, because that's not something primarily that departments of corrections and rehabilitation actually care about. So that was the whole push. For that act, and it's what kind of changed the telecommunications game in prisons. Um, how did you come back so quickly with such a clear picture? Were one of your children online and you beat them? No, hotspot. Well, yes, but I didn't have to beat them. And I'm using mobile headscott, right? Did you just make a face one of the moms? No, you didn't hear me when the camera went off. I was like, Somebody come help me and they didn't. Okay, well, that's good. Well, you know, shout out to good kids. Now, can you walk us through how companies like Securis and ViaPath came to dominate the prison telecom industry? What policies or market dynamics enabled their near-monopoly? Interestingly, Viapath and Securis pitch their communications specifically to prisons. They do other things like peddle media into prisons, but primarily they're the only two communications companies that do this, which leads to the problem we have now. It is an expensive thing to do because, as we'll talk about at this point, there's a lot of different moving parts when you're doing communications in a carceral environment. But they are the only two people, the only two companies in the game. What role did private equity play in building these companies in the billion-dollar empires? I mean, they're for-profit companies, just like prisons are. So, that's where a lot of the seed money for companies like this come from the private sector. There's nothing really public about them except that they're a public utilities company. Oh, they're privately owned, but just for prisons, right? They don't have any services for non-incarcerated people. They don't have any services. Some of them do, but they're not really communication services. And honestly, like, I don't know too much about what they do outside of prison communications. Because you are part of the lawsuit against these companies, correct? We have not filed a lawsuit yet. It is something that we are considering because of all the issues that have been going on and the fact that, as you so accurately said in the title, it is a monopoly. What should we understand about how these firms extract profit from incarceration? Because I don't think a lot of people understand how phone calls work. Because, first of all, most of the people that are going to be listening to this show understand prison as a place in movies they don't watch because there's too many black people in them. And, you know, there's a phone call in a hallway and then people fight over it. And that's not necessarily how they always look. There's tablets, there's computers, every prison looks a little different. But can you talk a little bit about how these things work? Yes. So I will tell you that one of the most popular shows in prison is 60 Days In, just in case anyone was wondering. And I have asked, actually, my daughter asked, she was like, is this accurate? And most of the people that I work with, they're like, yeah, it's pretty spot on. So there is no longer, well, I'll backtrack. There are, especially at the county jail level, which is a very, very different environment, there are still pay phones, like public phones in the day rooms. In the facilities, particularly state prisons, where Securis or VioPath, which was very recently GTL, provide telecommunication services, what it looks like is that each incarcerated person who can afford it can get a tablet. It's a very bottom-of-the-line Android type tablet. It's about yay big. Both of the companies provide those. And depending on the state you're in, depending on the facility you're in, the incarcerated person can make phone calls from their tablet between certain hours. They can send emails from their tablets that are always reviewed first by some kind of AI type review. And then if it grabs onto words that you're not supposed to use, it will delay your message until somebody at the facility. Yes. So you can't use words like, you know, it's funny, you can swear. You can't use words like threat. You can't use words like gang. You can't use words like weapon or gun or knife because your message will take forever to get there. Obviously, like sexual content is immediately pulled and then that goes to the facility level where they actually review it and then they'll notify you. They'll say your email is restricted for this. Particular reason. So, on tablets, you can do phone calls, email, in certain states and facilities. You can actually, there's a text function. You can set up video visits, but depending on the facility, you can't do them on your tablet generally. They have to be done at a kiosk in the day room so they're monitored. And then you can they can download media so they can purchase music, games, classes, and movies. That's where a lot of the money comes in because with the Martha Wright-Reed Act, there were a bunch of FCC rules that were recently implemented that said that these telecommunications companies have to provide telecommunication services, which basically is phone calls and video visits at a market rate. It was originally, I was actually just digging through my phone. It was originally before this went down a 30, a 20-minute phone call in Washington State through Securis, which is pretty standard rates, would cost you close to $6. 30-minute phone call. 20-minute phone call. 20-minute phone call. And that bill goes to the person on the outside. Yes. Oh, if you don't have family to put money on your Securis or your Viapath account, you don't use it. There's a way to transfer money from your inmate fund at certain facilities to your Securis or Viapath account, but it's onerous. It takes a long time. So where these telecommunications companies are making the money to make your short question really, really long, I'm sorry, is the media. So they can only charge a certain amount for calls and videos, but media is exorbitant. Songs start at $2.99, but can be as expensive as $9.99, $10.99, depending on the person. The amount of songs. But is it the person? Is it like, oh man, I got to get that new Taylor Swift? It's like that's $9.99. You know, I actually don't know. I filed a public records act request to get that information because there's really no specific information on how the pricing scale works. So I'm actually waiting on that because I was curious as well. I was like, is it a royalties thing? Is it like a, this person's really popular, so they're going to cost? I don't know. Movies can be anywhere from $9.99 to $24.99, depending on the movie. So movies cost as much as they did back in the day when there was no video cassettes. Right, because the FCC didn't rule on media content because it's not available everywhere. Gotcha. So that's where the majority of the money comes. But here's the thing. They also, we have to pay for the tablets. So if you don't have money on your inmate account or you have a family member that can, you know, send you $200 and some dollars, you're shit out of luck. You don't get a tablet. Those cost a lot of money. If the tablet breaks, if the tablet is lost, if the tablet is damaged in some way, you have to pay for a whole new one. That happens often in a prison setting, especially because they don't have cool stuff like, I mean, the tablets you can buy cases, but you know, they don't have cool stuff like wireless headphones. So you know how like when we all had wired headphones and we'd like turn our head and our shit would go flying off the table? That happens a lot. So they make money primarily off of media and then their contracts with these agents with these agencies. And are these tablets being resold? So for example, say somebody's inside for a couple years, they have a tablet, I'm sure they want to give it back, or is it theirs forever? They take it with them. It's they give it back. They can't take it with them. Can't take the media that they purchased. Can't take any of their music. There's talk about finding a way to put it on some kind of a cloud so they can download it later, but that's not been implemented-at least not by securists. Yeah, so I mean, if you have folks in there for 10, 15, 20 years, spend thousands of dollars on media because honestly, there's not a whole lot else to do, and our money's gone. It's kind of fascinating because this is where the two worlds align. Because we have these things in our pockets where we have the history of recorded music, but we don't own any of it. We're basically just renting it, right, for monthly fees, or maybe we're super cheap and don't pay and deal with the commercials. But there was a moment where you and I, when we were much younger, we bought and owned music, and that's what the music we had forever. And if someone sent you CDs, yeah, someone sent you CDs or cassettes in prison, you had CDs and cassettes that you took with you when you were released. Or you gave it to people because you were going to the free world and didn't want any reminders of your time inside. But this is also a problem that we have in today's marketplace where we've kind of we're so, I don't want to say a Addicted, but we've accepted the fact that we will own nothing. I don't even know. I don't know if you've been following a lot of artists are leaving Spotify because of royalty rates, which is whatever. But how are people going to listen to you? Because you ask yourself, like, okay, well, how is someone going to listen to you? No, I don't have random MP3s on my phone that I listen to, and I don't have a device anymore that would even play a CD. So the fact that these cats don't even have a cloud storage for this stuff is even more, is even more maddening. They know that it's never going to be theirs. I mean, that's kind of one of the most demoralizing things about incarceration. You own nothing personally. I mean, you can buy stuff, but it belongs to the prison. You can send certain things home. Like they can buy televisions from the supply company and they can send those home. They don't have to get left. Books, stuff like that. But no, digital media. I mean, I guess this is the big issue that a lot of us are maybe need to reckon with with digital media, the lack of ownership of anything. You know, if Spotify decides to change their rates, change their rates to $24 a month. Right. Are you going to pay it? Are you going to say, well, I'm going to lose all my playlists? Right. And here's the thing, though. And this is, I'm glad that you brought that up. This is the biggest crux of this issue is that if you want, if you were like, I don't want to pay Spotify's prices anymore, this is crap. I'm going to, you know, like Apple Music or whatever. You can. If you're incarcerated and you don't want to pay those prices, you should have luck. You don't have another choice. Just like if you want to call your family, you have to put that money on your phone or you cannot. Should we be looking at this as kind of a harbinger of things to come for where we are today with monopoly capital being so common? We're seeing all these telecom merges. ESPN is about to merge and have maybe one big kind of for-pay site where all their channels will be involved. And some people say maybe $30 a month. I don't know how much you pay for streaming services, but now for most people, depending on what streaming services you have, they've surpassed how much cable was. So there is no savings. Isn't this kind of just the reality of monopoly capital being sped up in the prison system? Is this where some of this stuff might even be experimented with? Because we all, the sad thing is, I feel like, and look, there's a huge difference between my life and someone that's incarcerated, but we're held captive by monopoly capital.

Right. But again, our recourses are, although I agree, they're dwindling. We have some. You know, I mean, eventually, yes, that's what it's media, access to media, access to music, access to movies. It's going to be so expensive. I mean, it already is, right? Who can go to a movie nowadays? I took my children to see a movie, just two of my children to see a movie. And with the movie and the, and I don't let them buy like copious amounts of whatever, it was like well over $100. Do you remember $2 Tuesdays at the Oaks? Like, what happened to that? Yeah, no, no. I haven't been to a movie in who's president now? I think Trump was in office the first time. The last time I was in the last time I was in the film, my youngest son wasn't alive, so it's been over seven years. It's too expensive. And so the answer to your question is yes. You know, we're seeing, and a lot of things that happen in prisons, I've noticed, are kind of like this reflective microcosm of what we're going through. But it's because it's in a vacuum basically, like the results are a lot quicker. And the problem is that, of course, it is creating an enormous gap between the people who have family members to support and who have finances and the people who don't. The people who can afford a tablet can also log into this thing called a dovo, which you can access. Tons of educational programs. You can take classes, you can get certifications. So these people have a much better opportunity to rehabilitate. And the people that have no money or no family, they don't get any of that. Is anyone doing any studies to see if that kind of cut off from the ability to, like I said, watch movies, listen to music, read a book? Does that change behavior? Or you don't know if there's any studies on that? There's tons of studies. I mean, and honestly, you can extrapolate and you don't have to go very far from studies that say that people who program in prison and people who take classes in prison and people who communicate with their families often in prison do better, are somewhat more emotionally healthy, and the recidivism rates are much, much lower. I actually work with a wonderful nonprofit in Washington called PUA. It's Power, Unity, and Action. And we are 501c4. I had their litigation unit. But we are actually, you know, looking at legislative possibilities to actually codify rules for communications. And we're kind of couching it under this idea that communication with the outside world and communication with teachers and mentors will improve public safety in that these people will rehabilitate and they will go home healthier and they will have the skills and the abilities to actually function in society. Because you're talking about people in prison, some of them have been there for 20. I have a loved one that's been in there for 35 years. And because of this access and because of a network, he has been able to run a business from prison. It's a nonprofit that does re-entry consulting, write books that are now on Amazon. There's a re-entry workbook that's popular on Amazon called Exit to Excellence. And he actually does a podcast from prison. And he is kind of the poster child for that and has been featured in newspaper articles and all kinds of stuff because he takes advantage of all of those resources. Podbean, your message amplified.

How did the practice, coming kind of back to the original conversation? How did the practice of, no, no, that's my fault. How did the practice of site commissions or kickbacks or correctional or correctional institutions influence pricing structures for prison calls? Okay, so the way that the pricing goes, here's the thing that people will not be surprised about, but have to understand. So these contracts for telecommunications in carceral settings, you bid on the contracts. And there's been a lot of wars in terms of like, there was a lawsuit that was filed here in the Eastern District of California against Securis for basically GTL, which is now Viapath, accused Securis of lowballing their RFPs, which is a response for the request for proposal. So they were lowballing their pricing. And then they lost that lawsuit. They lost the contract in California to CDCR. They now do all of the telecommunications in Washington. And, you know, the way that they make, the way that the agencies make money, there are what you call kickbacks, what they call reimbursements in their contracts. So like one of the main ways is in Washington in particular, the telecommunication system is very poor and it goes down all the time. It's one of the reasons why we have been investigating Securis for the last year. In the contract that Securis has with Washington DOC, there are specific line items that say, okay, if tablets go down, Securis has to fix this within 72 hours. If the video kiosks go down, they have to fix it within 24 hours. Written into the contract are daily penalty fees that they have to pay to Washington DOC when they are, when the fix takes longer than it's supposed to under the terms of the contract. So the problem with that is not just that that really is kind of a kickback, but Washington DOC has zero interest in fixing the problems that crop up. Pretty much every day because they actually make more money when the tablets are not working or when there are issues. And I mean, they don't actually care that the carceral population is cut off. This whole thing is about money. Like any prison. So, Securus is reportedly more than a billion in debt. What does this tell us about the fragility of these companies and the broader risks of financializing core services like telecommunications and prison? I think people are getting wise to Securis. I think I mentioned to you before, it's fast food telecommunications. So, you know, you can call ATT and be like, can I talk to a customer service person? Blah, blah, blah. Securus doesn't have that. Their customer service people, from what I have learned, like doing this research, a large majority of their customer service people are actually incarcerated people. They work phone bank. They don't know anything that's going on with Securis because they don't have access to that information. Wait, wait, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time. Let's rewind this a little bit. So the company that has monopolized prison communications and media uses slave labor. Incarcerated labor as customer service? We're still kind of digging into that, but it's something that I actually learned from somebody who used to work. Is it incarcerated labor in the States? So they could say they have American labor and they don't use overseas systems? Securus is based in Florida, which should come as no surprise. I think that's where most of the people that man the phone lines. But here's the problem: you call, you tell them that there's an issue. They tell you, we don't know anything about what's going on with the system because we're just in the phone booth. Then you say, hey, can I file a complaint or a grievance? And there's actually no vehicle for that. You can log into Securis and you can click file a complaint, and it gives you an email address to send a complaint to that has never responded. Two. So, well, you have a captive customer base. What are they going to do? Captive in the worst sense of the word, yes. Yeah, I didn't mean to make that joke. I really didn't. That was not the joke I was trying to make. And that wasn't good, but it's fine. You're spot on. It's I live in Mexico. And one of the things that I find interesting is when I first came here and things didn't work, I got mad. And a lot of things don't work here. And it's just a Mexico problem, right? It's, you know, the power is going to go out. The water is going to get shut off for no reason. No one's going to warn you. There's no customer service. No one gives a damn. And I always see people lose their shit at like the Wi-Fi company, for example, right? And it's like, no one's, no one cares. Either you're going to use it or you're not. And they're not going to move faster because you yelled. You're not going to sue anyone. There's no better business bureau that's going to give a shit about you and your complaint. So you learn pretty quick that this is just what it is. Is this kind of the future that we're moving towards, even in the outside world? Again, because monopoly is taking over every aspect of the way we move. Yeah, it's very much uh a harbinger of the demise of you know open communications you're the way you explain it is perfect too right like your wi-fi goes out it freaks you out you throw things you yell at a bunch of people yeah and then you go outside and touch grass or go get coffee. Imagine if you're locked in a cell. Yeah. And it's not just your Wi-Fi that's out. You can't call your family. You can't take your class. You can't listen to music. You can't read a digital book. You're literally sitting in a cement box while people who you know don't care anything about you are telling you, yeah, yeah, we'll fix it. But it is what we're coming to. We're coming to the point where when we call to complain about a service that we've paid for, all we get is, what are you going to do? Yeah, that's how do the, how do, how does that affect the psyche of the people on the inside as far as feeling so powerless? Do they then, when they, when they get released, are they also kind of ready to accept that this is just the way things are? It's actually a really good question. I don't know the answer to that. I think by and large, especially the people who spend a long time inside are just kind of relieved to not be inside. But it's demoralizing. I'll give you an example. Securus has technology issues all the time. A lot of it is Securis and the fact that they don't spend a whole lot of money on their infrastructure. Some of it is the facility. A good part of it is the facility. In Washington, in particular, there are a couple facilities that have very poor hardware. And as I'm sure people would understand, these tablets, these people, they don't have access to the internet. So this is a closed circuit. They're not pinging off of whatever tower is available. And so there was a time where people who were incarcerated in Washington who were from out of state, and there are several hundred of them at least, the tablets went down for everyone. The system went down for everyone. And when it came back online a day or so later, all of the out-of-state borders were wiped from the system. They're just gone. And they had no access to anything for almost two weeks. And again, there's no customer service. You can't call. If anybody's ever tried to call a prison, there's not really a live person. And so you get those secret back door numbers that take forever to get. And so, yeah, these folks sit in their cells and their families wonder where they are. I mean, I can tell you, having loved ones inside when you're sitting there and you know your person calls at five o'clock every day and then you don't hear from them for 24 hours, it's terrifying. It's prison. It could be the tablets are down. They could be dead in the cafeteria. Like you just don't know. And there's nobody to call. Just like with your family members, I've had people complain to me that their family members have missed birthdays, funerals, Christmas, business meetings, lawyer visits. There's no remedy. And, you know, you pitch this to the general public and they don't care because the majority of people really do still feel like, well, these are incarcerated people. They shouldn't have any privileges whatsoever. But we're past that. I do want to stay on that for a minute because I think that's an important point that you hit on. Originally, I had that written into my introduction and took it out, but I do think that we're talking about a population that most people, you know, in this space and left media, maybe pay some sort of rhetorical fealty to. But in actuality, you know, dealing with said population and, you know, saying the right words about them are two extremely different things. And there's a couple populations that I feel like are kind of throwaway populations. The only reason why I think this one is a little bit better than the homeless population is because a lot of people can come out and actually be integrated into society and the workforce opposed to the majority of the unhoused population that can't. And so people don't care about what happens inside unless it's super egregious. And then maybe it's a passing, oh, that sucks. Like, you know, fight clubs that guards run. There is no rape. There's not too much. There's female inmates that it has to be female inmates that happens. No. Priya covers male inmates too. But I know, but I'm saying, I'm saying what people actually care. Here's the problem. It's not, I actually somewhat disagree with you. It's not, it's not that it takes something, you know, big for people to care. One, you're never going to know. Unless you're in this industry, none of this is ever, you know, publicized unless, like you said, a really big thing happens. But I actually think the overall issue is that most people in the general public think that the people inside actually deserve what they're getting. So you believe most people believe most people on the outside don't care? Yes. Unless they have an incarcerated loved one or are in some way in this ecosystem, you wouldn't. Here, I'll tell you how I know this for sure. So when I go to visits, in-person visits, the COs at the visiting unit treat me as if I had committed crimes and was just by chance walking on the outside of the facility. People don't like us because we're the family members of the incarcerated. People can't stand the incarcerated. They think it's this bubbling anger that's just kind of, you know, it's in the water now. They're an easy target. You know, for all extents and purposes, we believe that they've done bad things. You know, we believe that they've hurt people. And we completely forget that it's supposed to be the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Most people feel like these people are so heinous that you throw away the key. They don't even think twice about them. It's not even they waste their time thinking about them. They're gone. They've disappeared. I mean, there are people in there that have done bad things, right? Yes, absolutely. But the large majority of the people who are in there, I would characterize it, a lot of it, not all of it. And the people inside will be the first people to tell you, like, there's some really, really awful people in here. But they're the minority. And the majority are people that made mistakes or who did things because that's how they were raised, or there was, you know, cultural pressures, or there was generational trauma. Like, it's a million different things. The reports that even DOC puts out right now, somewhere around 80% to 95% of people who are incarcerated have significant trauma in their backgrounds. They're significantly traumatized. They have PTSD. And then we put them in prison, which is probably one of the most traumatizing experiences 24 hours a day. I mean, you're talking about constant noise. The kind of noise that, like, what was it? Who did we, the United States? Noriega. The kind of noise that we used on Noriega to flush him out of his little mansion all those years ago. It's that level. It's like noise pollution. It smells. It's dirty. People are constantly fighting. I mean, it's a very traumatizing place to be. But most of the people out here think that that's what they deserve. And so trying to mount this fight for telecommunications, for access to communications, to access to resources, it's a very difficult fight because most people look at what I'm saying and go, why should they even get that? What do you say to those people? It behooves all of us that they get that. The recidivism rate for people that have functional communication with their families, programs, education is far, far lower than the people that aren't given access to it or are unable to participate in it. And I'm talking like the recidivism rate for people who just sit there and do nothing is probably around 65, 70%. The recidivism rate for these guys that we are seeing who are now having access to programming and education, it's dropping down to the high 30s to the low 30s. I mean, we're cutting the recidivism rate in half. Well, we recently did a show kind of talking about the more so about black people and mass incarceration because the statistics have changed drastically. We're looking at possibly the next 10 years, possibly. Now things are changing a little bit with the current administrations, but possibly having less than a million people incarcerated, which would be huge for the United States. Right now, statistically, a black person is more likely to be a college graduate than incarcerated. So things are changing, and there's a whole bunch of reasons why we don't have to get into. That's a whole different show. You know, one big thing that's changing is, you know, these criminal empires that people assume everybody had so many years ago back before the legalization of every single fucking vice from gambling to cocaine. Cocaine's legal now? Well, Adderall. That's meth. Tomato. Tometho. Tometho. But there's a reality that also the systems that were in place for people to kind of return to a street and have like captive drug audiences and a series of underground economies, they're just not there the way they were 20, 30 years ago. So if you were locked up, if you've been locked up for 30 years, the world just doesn't look different because technically it doesn't really look that different. Everything that exists now kind of existed when you were in. It's just there were systems that existed before they got you inside that don't even exist anymore. And here's an interesting thing though for you because that is true. And the folks that are in the longest do have a harder time connecting to the current world if they haven't been given the opportunity or haven't taken part in the resources. But I'll tell you this: releasing inmates who are over the age of 50 and have spent more than 20 years in the recidivism rate is damn near nothing. Yeah. And I mean, a lot of that is just they want to go home. But a lot of that is what we're starting to see is that there are these tablets, there are constant communications. You know, I like the mention that you made in the beginning, is like our idea of phones in prison is, you know, everybody waiting in line for a payphone. And it's not like that anymore. But the benefit of that is. My loved one can be having a really hard day and sitting in his room, right? And can call and be like, I'm having a really hard day. And it can be a private conversation for the most part. I mean, except for all the people listening in on the conversation. But, like, you know, he can call at almost any time, right? Or call anybody or access a program on, you know, emotional well-being. So it's, there's, there's no downside. There's so much security baked into these systems that there's just no downside to giving access to these people. Are you finding allies in your fight? Because I think what's interesting about this is as tough on crime rhetoric as is being used on a bipartisan level to attempt to win elections. I just recently wrote the latest crisis papers for TIR patrons. It's out right now. There is an anemic line between vengeance and justice. And a lot of people are very vengeful. But when you see it play out, let's say in the Trump regime, people feel a little different when you actually see it play out, right? Seeing people get snatched up out of work, kids getting snatched out of school. No one likes seeing that. They thought all the bad people were going to go away. And it's like, no, the easy-to-catch brown people are going to go away. And maybe we'll give a shit about whoever the fuck the bad people are later. Maybe. But, you know, this is a show. But I feel like this may be a great time to get people on board. Have I found allies? Sure, people who have loved ones inside. Not just for people that have loved ones inside, but people that are upset about what they're seeing. If you feel Trump is a fascist. They're not seeing it, Jason. That's the problem. Sure. I mean, the media will eat up the high school kid that was walking his dog and got picked up by ICE and sent to Alligator Alcatraz. The media is not going to eat up, you know, the guys that are sitting around waiting for the opportunity to call their wives or call their mothers or call their children who are just suffering emotionally because of it. The media doesn't care about them. Nobody's going to see it. So you can't raise awareness and you can't stomp the ground and gather people together because there's nothing to see. I mean, unless someone is interested in this, they're not going to see what really goes on. So do I have allies? Sure, people in my position or people that have taken an interest for one reason or another in this industry. But the problem is that most attorneys, rightfully so, are afraid to take on departments of correction. It's 100% the David versus Goliath type of endeavor. They have all the money and all the lawyers in the world. And as soon as a jail or a prison says, well, we're doing this for the safety of the people inside in the community, everybody stops talking. It's not true, but everybody stops talking. Let me give you an example, if I can, because to humanize it a little bit. So I have a loved one who has been inside for 35 years. And he grew up poor, black, and the child of addicts in Baltimore in the 1980s. Was involved in an assault and was, as a 19-year-old, sentenced to two life sentences plus 20 years. 35 years later, is he prepared to leave? Yes, but only because he took advantage of every single resource that there possibly could be offered to him. Is he ready to reintegrate into society? As best as he can be. And he knows this, and I think that's what gives him a leg up. He's the one, like I said, that does the podcast. It's called The Wall Behind and Beyond. I would suggest people give it a listen because you can really hear what's going on. But my point is, did he get what he deserved? Has he paid enough? 35 years for a non-homicide shooting. His children have grown up. He's never met his own grandson. Has he paid enough? Can we now give him the privilege of a tablet? You're never going to see these stories on the news. Sorry for the tiger stripe from my son's. No, look, look, you know, because you know me personally, so you know. I'm with you on that fight because I, which is ultimately what I, what I wrote about in that recent article, is that we don't care about who we perceive as bad because for years, the messaging that we get is justice for so-and-so. Right. Right. So-and-so needs their justice. And I've always thought to myself, well, I don't know what that means because you know, I'm a family member of my uncle was murdered. The person that killed him is in prison. He's never getting out. I don't feel safer. I still lock my door when I go to the Bay Area. You know, like that didn't, that didn't make the world a better place. No. And maybe because that happened at such a young age, it's just affected me different when I when I think about people that talk about justice and you know, our family's never going to be the same, right? So I don't know what justice is supposed to look like for people that talk about, well, this is so-and-so needs justice. And I'm like, okay, well, like you said, the guy's been inside for 35 years. He's got to be in his 50s. Fuck is he going to do in his 50s? He owns a business. Well, you know, what is job offers? I mean, he's going to live the best life he possibly can. Yeah. He deserves that. And but here's the thing: like we have to reevaluate what justice is. It's something that we haven't done since the 94 crime bill. And nobody agreed with that that was the right perspective on justice either. But at this point, I think if you can get this message out there, I think there are more people that if you actually humanize all of these people, and they are all deserving of support. They're all deserving of redemption. They're all deserving of forgiveness. If you look at it like that, yes, your uncle was murdered and it was horrible. It was horrible for your family. It was tragic. It impacted your lives forever. And you deserve some kind of justice for that. But is seeing a teenager rot in jail for 40 years is that going to bring you justice? It's not going to bring you solace. And knowing you, I don't think it would even make you feel good. That's what we have to look at. Justice is a global thing. It's not just for him or for her or for them. It's one of the things that I try to, that I actually learned from my loved one and that I try to tell people all the time. Justice is this kind of whole thing. It's not just somebody going to prison, somebody paying restitution. It's somebody making amends. It's somebody finding forgiveness for themselves and asking for forgiveness from other people. It's somebody being given the opportunity to right their wrongs. We don't have an idea of what justice is anymore. And I mean, unfortunately, this administration is not going to help. I mean, I don't think another one would. I agree with you that we don't have an idea of what it looks like. And I definitely think that I don't want it to have to come down to such an interpersonal level where people have to see what goes on kind of on both sides of the spectrum, right? Like I also know some, I know quite a few people that have committed capital felonies and it doesn't go away. It's not like, oh, well, you know, I did that a long time ago. It's all chill. Like, no, it's it still fucks with them, even if they have become better people because you have to live with them for the rest of your life. So I do, in my volunteer time, I do meditation. I do peer counseling. I actually have an incredibly good friend who recommended this book called No Bad Parts, which everybody should check out. I read that with some of the people that I work with. I can tell you unequivocally that all of the people that I've met, particularly the people I consider to be my loved ones, they agonize over what they did to their families, to their friends, to their communities, and to their direct victims. They agonize over it all the time. It's one of the things that keeps them up at night. It's one of the things that makes them feel unworthy for going home. It's not like they go inside and they have a ball and they're all sitting on their tablets playing video games and drinking pink soda. It's miserable in there and they are also kind of captive in their own heads because without the kind of stuff that I do with them, there's no mental health service. You can kite mental health when you feel like you're going to kill yourself. They'll take you in for an appointment, maybe prescribe you some drugs and they'll send you back to your room. If these people are given the opportunity to learn these things about themselves, Like it would be a total game changer. But here again, sorry, I'm kind of getting off the subject, but DOCs, CDCR, all these prisons, they don't want that to happen. High recidivism rates lie in their pockets. This is a for-profit industry. So, anybody that thinks that somebody goes into prison is getting restorative justice or some kind of rehabilitation, the prisons are not providing those because it behooves them not to. They send people home who stay out and don't come back, they don't make money. That being said, I do think there's a pivot, and we're seeing that pivot in the immigrant population, where majority of private prisons are to hold indefinitely, what do you call them, civil detention, right? Does that seem to be the quote-unquote logical pivot that private prisons are making in your estimation? Yes, it's a logical pivot because private prisons don't generally have much of a hand in the state carceral system. But private prisons for immigration detainees, that's been for decades. The biggest private prison, the biggest private prison company, and of course, I've completely lost the name, something global, something whatever. The CEO of that company used to work for ICE and CBP. Private prisons have profited off of immigration enforcement for decades. The two largest private prisons that house only immigration detainees are in Arizona out in the desert. One's in Florence, one's in Eloy. And they make a ton of money because they can hold these people indefinitely. Well, back to what we were talking about, because that's a whole different show. What organizing strategies have been the most effective in challenging these telecom monopolies? And who are the people and the groups doing the work on the ground? Okay, that's a good question. And I'm going to start by not answering your question, but I'll get to it. Okay, so one of the problems with suing companies like Securis, there's this thing called the PLRA, which is the Prison Litigation and Reform Act. And it really, really, really limited the lawsuits that inmates could file. So not only there's an exhaustion requirement, so you have to exhaust all of your administrative revenues before you file a lawsuit, there's also a numerical requirement for frivolous lawsuits. So having these guys sue Securis is almost an impossibility. However, the people that we are organizing now are the family members. We're paying the money. So we can sue as customers since we sign a customer agreement. We can sue under the PUC. We can sue in small claims court. Arguably, we could put a class action together. How we organize these people, it's literally social media. We have the nonprofit that I work for is run by a wonderful woman named Kaylani Walker, and she started a program. She started a nonprofit before this that was really instrumental in helping during COVID to get substantive resources. And so Facebook, we have a Facebook group for every facility that we service, and all the family members are in it. There are Facebook groups now for Securis, JPEG, GTL, and Biopath. And those groups, I'm in most of them, it's constantly people complaining about what's going on. So then we start posting, hey, send us, you know, send us your needs, send us your, send us what you want. Send us your worst stories. You know, what are you looking for? We've been telling people, you know, gather your records together, save all of your records. It's hard to organize because, again, it's a marginalized group of people, and there's not a ton of family members. You know, we're stigmatized by incarceration as well. There's not a ton of family members who are kind of like waving that red flag, oh, my person's incarcerated because we are judged and looked down upon. So it's really hard to like find these people outside of social media groups. We also post flyers sometimes, although we've gotten in trouble for doing that in visiting rooms, but we have posted flyers about, you know, services or, hey, if this has happened to you, give us a call. We've set up emails. We've let our incarcerated people know to tell their family members. But it's an excellent question because it's a very hard group to rally. Most of them are also impoverished. Oof, that's a very important caveat. What can our listeners, especially those not directly affected, do to support this fight? Okay, that's a great question. Okay, so prisons and jails allow people, after a vetting process, to come in and provide resources or education. If you are a creative writer or you love to do pottery, go and see if you can offer these services at your local county. Jail or at your local state prison. You can also get involved. The way I got involved, I was looking around for networks to support people on the inside and found a wonderful network that I just started helping people who are on the inside because they need people who are willing to post on social media for them. Okay, they need people who can write letters for them, make phone calls for them, you know, write basic letters or teach them how. I mean, you can really offer any skill set, and these people would be thrilled to take advantage of it. You can also, you know, look up my organization. Hopefully, Jason will post it somewhere. You can frequent the podcasts that I mentioned earlier. It doesn't have to be monetary assistance. Like, this is really kind of one of those grassroots things where any skill that you have and any time you're willing to give, you can find a way to do it. Make bridge the gap. Like, make a connection with somebody inside. It doesn't have to be one of those kind of weird, sketchy, like dating sites. There are lots of places that you can go and offer your services to people who are on the inside. I mean, I feel like JPEG is just a pimp service. You should see the inmate dating websites. But that's not a dating website because we watch JPEG videos in the champagne room. Did you? Dude, JPEG has a, I believe they do have a dating website. The amount. No, go ahead. Idaho. I don't know what's in the water in Idaho, but apparently the JPEG Idaho Instagram for men and women. I'll tell you what's in the water. Boredom. What did you say? What's in the water? Boredom? Boredom is in the water. Well, look, they're coming on there and they're like, look, I'm bye. I want to be a sugar baby. And some of them, the comments are what's funny. It's not the people. It's the people in the comments that are like, whatever she did, it's not that bad. And now some people in their JPEG dating pitches are saying what they did because they give their prison number, of course. It's all public information. Well, so here's the thing. Those dating websites, all the dating websites, these aren't actually people posting. It's somebody's doing it for them. They can't post directly. Nobody on the inside has access to the internet. They're all inside. They're all inside. They're all inside, but somebody's doing the posts for them. Also, we do the posting for, okay, we can't have access to that from the inside. So literally what it is, is what I do with social media with some of my guys that have social media is they'll write a post, ask me to post a picture. You know, they'll say like, oh, I want it to look like this, and I'll find a picture. And then I'll post it. And then I'll literally read them the comments. And they'll respond to some of the comments. And it's not quite like doing it yourself, but it's close enough. Dating stuff, that's a champagne room discussion. Yeah, it's we again, we only watch it in the champagne room, but I am convinced that JPEG is just a pimping service. I mean, in some ways, it all is, right? Like Securist, JPEG, ViaPath, like they're making connections between people who are looking for specific things. I will tell you, like the video visits, very, very strictly regulated. Phone calls, not so much. Well, wherever you're watching or listening to this show, I will put links in the description. If I don't have them already, I don't remember. This show was supposed to happen a while ago. And someone with a spotty internet connection had backed out. Her name rhymes with Messica Fanfuis. Well, you're doing serious work, so that's important. So, thank you for taking the time to talk with us. Are you going to join us in the champagne room for a little bit? I wouldn't miss the champagne room for all the champagne in the world. And I don't drink. There you go. You guys had it or heard it first. Jessica's going to join us in the champagne room. One of the rare occurrences where a guest is so confident in their employment that they are willing to come into the champagne room and watch horrible hood videos with me. I will preface this champagne room tonight by saying I watched over two hours of the No Jumper podcast, and now I understand Candace Owens a lot better. I don't think D.W. Griffith could have written that show. Richard Wright definitely shuddered. So, thank you. You again, Jessica. Again, wherever you guys are watching or listening, thank you guys. Click the links. Jessica's doing very, very, very important work. Um, I want you to know I appreciate everything that you do. Um, and I'm sure the listeners and viewers today do as well. We'll see you guys in the champagne room. And we are
