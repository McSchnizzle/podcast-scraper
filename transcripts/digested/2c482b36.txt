[00:00] Okay, so Google yesterday released their
[00:02] nano banana model. So I went ahead today
[00:04] and built my own app with this API and I
[00:07] tell you it's so cool. You can do so
[00:10] much cool stuff with this. So today I
[00:12] just wanted to show you a few of the
[00:14] things I have come up with so far. So we
[00:16] can start with this Photoshop feature I
[00:19] have. So I uploaded like a can of soda
[00:22] here. This is Pepsi. So I have my brush.
[00:25] I can do something like yeah I can brush
[00:28] this logo here and I can just go to the
[00:31] text box right and I can say something
[00:34] like a CocaCola logo style. So let's see
[00:37] what happens if we just edit this area.
[00:40] So I can kind of mask this and I can
[00:43] send in both images what's happening in
[00:45] the back end. We compare them kind of
[00:47] and we get a result back. So I'm just
[00:49] going to show you how this turned out.
[00:50] We can do a few more examples before I
[00:52] show you the other features I have
[00:55] generated here. Okay. So, I upload this
[00:57] image here of uh Taylor Swift, right? I
[00:59] can just take kind of her bangs here if
[01:02] I wanted to. Right? Something like this.
[01:04] I don't know. And I can say pink hair.
[01:07] Let's try that. See what happens. So,
[01:09] you can see I just selected kind of her
[01:11] front hair here in her forehead. So,
[01:14] let's see how that turns up uh when we
[01:16] kind of do the masking part here in
[01:18] photo edit mode. Okay. So, I wouldn't
[01:21] say this was perfect, but it's not too
[01:22] bad, right? It kind of blends in very
[01:24] good. So, yeah, that is something we can
[01:26] do. We can probably come back to this
[01:28] Photoshop mode, but let's just some show
[01:30] you a bit about the other stuff. Uh, of
[01:32] course, we have the multi image. Uh,
[01:33] here I can upload two images, right? So,
[01:36] let's do this woman here. She's like,
[01:38] uh, yeah, I don't know, doing some
[01:40] marathon. We can do the Pepsi can. And
[01:43] let's just merge these images. So let me
[01:45] do like a female drinking a can of
[01:50] Pepsi, right? So this is going to take
[01:54] both images and kind of merge them into
[01:56] one. This is something we can do with
[01:58] the nano banana API. Uh we can of course
[02:01] do single image, but that is kind of
[02:03] standard. Uh but after we have done
[02:05] this, I'm going to show you kind of the
[02:07] uh the other feature I've done too that
[02:09] is pretty cool. Okay, so we have the
[02:11] result. That is just amazing, right?
[02:13] Look how good that is. Look at the can
[02:15] here. Uh I guess it's a bit strange it's
[02:17] drinking with both hand, but it looks
[02:19] pretty awesome. Uh some other thing you
[02:21] can see we added a Pepsi ad in the
[02:23] background here. It looks like that,
[02:25] right? That's a bit strange. Uh but now
[02:28] I can show you the video generation
[02:30] feature. So every generated images kind
[02:32] of is passed over here. So now we can
[02:35] animate this. I can say something like
[02:38] uh let me show you female drinking a can
[02:43] of uh soda right
[02:47] uh so yeah let's do 5 seconds this is
[02:50] using the cling uh 2.1 pro model so now
[02:54] we can take uh every image we edit with
[02:56] nano banana and just uh turn it into a
[02:59] video this is something super simple you
[03:01] can do when you kind of uh get kind of
[03:04] to know with the API And you can see
[03:06] here 2.5 Pro video generation. Uh the
[03:09] kind of the generation is just passed
[03:11] over to the input image. So this is so
[03:14] cool. I'm really looking forward to
[03:15] building more stuff uh or building out
[03:18] this app with more features. Uh I just
[03:20] had so much fun this morning playing
[03:22] around with this. So let's just wait for
[03:24] the video and let's check it out. Okay.
[03:26] So you can see we have it here now. So
[03:28] let's play it. Right. There's no audio,
[03:30] right? But that's something we can do if
[03:31] you wanted to. So you can see she is now
[03:34] drinking. Uh having a sip of the Pepsi,
[03:37] right? Perfect. What can I say? We could
[03:39] have done 10 seconds too, but that's
[03:41] just really cool. Uh so that is
[03:43] something we can do. We can come back to
[03:45] this. Uh but I have another feature I
[03:47] wanted to show you. This is the time
[03:48] travel feature. So for this, I think I
[03:51] want to do an image. Uh I just took a
[03:53] screenshot of myself here, right? So
[03:56] yeah, not the best. But uh here we can
[03:59] select stages, right? So this is I call
[04:02] this the time travel feature. All right.
[04:05] So, upload an image. Describe how you
[04:07] want it to evolve through time. So, I'm
[04:10] going to do four stages. And here you
[04:13] can describe uh evolve through the
[04:15] different historical eras. We can try
[04:17] that. Uh but let's do let's do show
[04:21] image from 1970s to 2000s. I don't know
[04:25] how this is going to turn out, but let's
[04:26] try to do those four stages. Right. So
[04:29] the way I did this like technically is I
[04:32] just using uh GPD5 nano to rewrite the
[04:37] prompts. So if we go all down here uh
[04:39] let me see. Yeah, you can see we are
[04:42] rewriting the prompts here. Transform
[04:44] this scene into 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and
[04:48] vibrant '7s. So we're just using
[04:51] Nano to do this. So uh I'm going to take
[04:54] you back when we have the four results
[04:56] here. 1970s vibe, right? Okay. So, this
[05:00] was Oh, this was kind of embarrassing.
[05:03] So, okay. So, here's me. 1970s. This was
[05:06] a bit strange, maybe. Uh, I don't even
[05:09] want to see 80s. Look at this. Okay.
[05:12] It's pretty good, right? It kind of
[05:14] looks like me, but look at this outfit
[05:16] and the hairstyle. So, something failed
[05:19] here at 90s. I don't know. This doesn't
[05:21] even look like me. I'm not quite sure.
[05:23] But 2000s was pretty good, right? So,
[05:27] oops. Uh, so let's take a look at this
[05:29] one. Uh, okay. That's a slick back. So,
[05:34] I'm pretty impressed, right? It looks
[05:36] pretty good. So, let me do something
[05:39] else here with the time travel feature.
[05:40] That's pretty fun. So, do something like
[05:43] um
[05:45] I'm going to do historic uh leaders or
[05:48] something. Okay. So, again, I think the
[05:50] results were very good. So, this is
[05:52] ancient. Is this me as Jesus? That's
[05:55] pretty good. Uh, next one is medieval.
[05:59] So, here I am a drawing, but I think
[06:02] it's cool. Next up is modern.
[06:05] Look at this style. That's pretty cool.
[06:08] I don't know what the last one is.
[06:09] Contemporary.
[06:11] That's just me. Okay, pretty cool. Uh, I
[06:15] need to come up with one more thing. I
[06:17] just think this feature is so fun. So,
[06:19] let me do me as magic cards or something
[06:22] like this. So, this is pretty fast
[06:24] because we're doing it in parallel. So,
[06:26] you can see here is the heroic wizard.
[06:28] This is me, right? That's pretty cool. I
[06:31] like that. I even have my cap on. Let's
[06:33] say the next one. This is a legendary
[06:36] creature human wizard. Okay, I can see
[06:39] that. Yurun. Okay. Uh, next up, we have
[06:44] uh 3VU.
[06:47] Again, looks like me. Pretty cool. Arch
[06:50] Mage Terron. When an arcade terron
[06:53] enters the battlefield, screw two. Okay,
[06:57] not the most impressive. Maybe the text
[06:59] isn't best here. Uh, again, that kind of
[07:02] looks like me. His Ragnar whispered
[07:04] secrets of ancient something something.
[07:07] Uh, but again, pretty cool. Um, I want
[07:10] to do one more a couple of more things.
[07:13] Uh, I kind of want to do uh some merging
[07:15] and turning into a video. I think this
[07:18] is a great potential of things you can
[07:20] do. So, let me take like a a model, a
[07:22] product, and let's turn it into a video.
[07:25] Okay. So, I found this image here of a
[07:27] celebrity. I found a floor jack. And
[07:29] let's see what happens if we do these
[07:31] two and we do something like woman
[07:33] changing her tires on her car with a new
[07:36] floor jack. So, I'm going to send this.
[07:39] Um, I don't even know. Do they have like
[07:41] this celebrity? Uh, I haven't really
[07:44] tried it out, but if this doesn't work,
[07:46] I'm just going to take another person,
[07:48] not a famous person. Let's just see what
[07:50] happens here. Okay, so this was so good.
[07:52] Look at this.
[07:55] I'm going to download this. But look,
[07:57] that is like Taylor Swift like changing
[07:59] her tires. So now we can go to the video
[08:02] generation, right? And we can say woman
[08:07] changing her uh tires with the a new
[08:13] floor jack.
[08:15] Smiling.
[08:17] Smiling. Right. So, let's send this.
[08:20] Let's do 5 seconds and let's grab this
[08:23] video. So, if I wanted to sell this card
[08:26] jack, right, that's perfect. Okay, so
[08:29] let's check it out here. I'm going to
[08:31] blow this up like big screen. Uh, maybe
[08:33] my head is in the way. Let's do
[08:35] something like this, right? Let's see
[08:38] this.
[08:40] Okay. Uh, okay. So, the floor jack move
[08:43] that maybe wasn't perfect.
[08:46] I wouldn't say that was very good, but
[08:47] the image is good. I don't know what's
[08:50] happening here. Uh, but still it's
[08:52] pretty fun, right? So, yeah, you can do
[08:54] a lot of stuff with just this simple
[08:56] pipeline here. Okay, so I want to do a
[08:59] thumbnail with this image here. So,
[09:01] let's see what I can do uh using kind of
[09:03] the Photoshop tool. So, I can do I can
[09:06] do the brush something like this. And I
[09:09] can just kind of just brush all of this,
[09:11] right? The full thing here. That should
[09:14] be pretty good. Let's see if I can do
[09:16] that. Yeah, that should cover it, right?
[09:19] And I can just maybe try to fill in the
[09:25] left side of image to fit with rest.
[09:30] Let's see what happens. So, I'm going to
[09:32] send this. Haven't tried this. So, I'm
[09:35] going to take you back when we have the
[09:36] result. Okay. So, I wouldn't say this
[09:38] was perfect. You can see kind of the
[09:40] reflection is a bit bug, but let's see.
[09:41] Uh, I'm going to download it and I'm
[09:43] going to try to use this as the
[09:44] thumbnail. I'm going to add some text
[09:46] here and stuff. Maybe it doesn't show
[09:48] that well. Uh, one more thing. Uh, I
[09:51] wanted to do multi-image. I want to
[09:53] upload uh let's say I found this uh what
[09:57] was this? Uh, yeah, this was my logo. I
[10:00] was going to place that. So, this is
[10:02] like some image I found of a girl. And
[10:05] let's do my logo. Not that one. Uh, this
[10:09] one. Not that one, but this one. Right.
[10:12] And I'm going to say female model
[10:15] hauling up a sign uh of the all about AI
[10:17] YouTube channel banner. Insert like and
[10:18] subscribe invite above 69 format.
[10:22] Haven't tried this. Don't know what's
[10:23] going to happen. I don't think we will
[10:25] get the 69 format here. So, I don't
[10:28] think this is going to work, but let's
[10:30] give it a try. Uh so while we wait for
[10:32] that if you want to try out this app
[10:34] here uh if you're a member of the
[10:36] channel or if you become a member of the
[10:38] channel I have uploaded the app to
[10:41] GitHub Nano Banana. So this is the M AI
[10:45] image uh editor and video generator
[10:47] right. So all the code should be up now
[10:49] if you want to try it out if you are a
[10:51] member of the channel. If not just
[10:52] follow the link in description and I
[10:54] will invite you to the GitHub repo. So
[10:58] yeah, there's a lot of potential in this
[10:59] web app here. You can kind of turn it
[11:01] into whatever you want. Uh okay, we got
[11:04] something here, right? Uh not perfect.
[11:08] Uh let's do like and describe invite
[11:12] above her uh dark movie set. Something
[11:16] like this. Let's try that. Give it one
[11:19] more chance. But yeah, like I said, if
[11:21] you're a member, become a member. you
[11:23] can get access to this app and you can
[11:25] just uh plug and play and try it out for
[11:27] yourself. So I did create this with the
[11:30] model. So this is probably going to be
[11:31] the thumbnail you are seeing on this
[11:33] video, right? Uh so that was pretty
[11:35] cool. Uh so we put in this model and my
[11:38] uh YouTube thing. So we kind of ended up
[11:40] with this. Uh it's not perfect, but uh
[11:42] go ahead like and subscribe. Uh it looks
[11:45] pretty cool. So I hope this gave you
[11:47] some inspiration and this made you want
[11:49] to go try out the new Nano Banana API.
[11:52] Uh I'm running it to through fal uh but
[11:57] you could do it through Google I think
[11:58] too and you can also play around in
[12:00] Google studio. This is where I kind of
[12:02] created this. So that works also pretty
[12:04] good. So yeah, superb interesting model.
[12:07] I had a lot of fun playing around with
[12:09] it and I'm definitely going to keep
[12:10] adding features to this app here. So
[12:13] yeah, thank you for tuning in. Have a
[12:14] great day and I'll see you again
[12:15] hopefully very
