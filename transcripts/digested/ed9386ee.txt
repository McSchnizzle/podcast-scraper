[00:00] Welcome back to the AI Daily Brief
[00:01] headlines edition. All the daily AI news
[00:03] you need in around 5 minutes. We kick
[00:06] off today with an interesting
[00:07] partnership announcement Meta has struck
[00:09] a new deal with Midjourney. On Friday,
[00:12] Meta's new chief AI officer, Alexander
[00:14] Wang, posted on XT today. We're proud to
[00:16] announce a partnership with Midjourney
[00:18] to license their aesthetic technology to
[00:20] our future models and products, bringing
[00:21] beauty to billions. This technical
[00:23] collaboration between our research teams
[00:25] is part of our effort to team up with
[00:26] the best companies in the industry whose
[00:28] work and expertise complements our own.
[00:30] We are incredibly impressed by
[00:31] MidJourney. They've accomplished true
[00:33] feats of technical and aesthetic
[00:34] excellence and we're thrilled to be
[00:36] working more closely with them to ensure
[00:37] Meta is able to deliver the best
[00:39] possible products for people. It will
[00:40] require taking an all of the- above
[00:42] approach. This means world-class talent,
[00:44] ambitious compute roadmap, and working
[00:46] with the best players across the
[00:47] industry. Midjourney founder David Holes
[00:49] wrote, "Bringing sublime tools of
[00:51] creation and beauty to billions of
[00:52] people is squarely within our mission,
[00:54] excited to partner with the titans of
[00:55] industry to make this happen." However,
[00:57] he also confirmed, quote, "We remain an
[00:59] independent community-backed research
[01:00] lab with no investors working on a
[01:02] staggering array of ambitious projects
[01:04] focused on bringing about humane futures
[01:06] where we are all midjourney. Join us."
[01:08] Now, this one is super interesting.
[01:10] Midjourney has always had a pretty
[01:12] fascinating place in the AI image
[01:14] generation pantheon and that it is just
[01:16] really aesthetically tasteful. I've said
[01:18] before that my first conversion
[01:20] experiences into the world of AI were
[01:22] largely with Midjourney. I would imagine
[01:24] dreamy scenes from history like Ernest
[01:26] Hemingway in Paris in the 1920s. As
[01:28] their models have evolved, they've
[01:30] continued to get better and more
[01:31] tasteful and more interesting and more
[01:32] visually arresting. Although they
[01:34] haven't evolved in some of the ways that
[01:35] other tools have, which have left them
[01:37] in a different use case column for me
[01:39] and many others. When you see an image
[01:41] like a cover image or a thumbnail on one
[01:42] of my videos, it's almost invariably
[01:44] created by Ideogram. Sometimes it's from
[01:47] OpenAI, which you can usually tell from
[01:49] the weird yellow tint, but I would say
[01:51] that the vast majority of time it is in
[01:53] fact ideog. Ideogram has the best
[01:55] fidelity to text, most closely follows
[01:57] my instructions, and ends up being
[01:59] really good for the day in dayout
[02:00] business sort of use cases. When I need
[02:02] to do something visually arresting
[02:04] though, something where the main
[02:05] determinant of success is beauty or just
[02:07] visual interestingness, then I'm turning
[02:09] to Midjourney. This has led people to
[02:12] wonder what Meta is going to do with the
[02:13] company. The Verge suggested that in
[02:15] their words, Meta is going to stuff
[02:17] Midjourney AI images into your feed,
[02:18] which some think is terrible, but which
[02:20] others rightly point out that since
[02:21] Facebook is already inundated with AI
[02:23] images, leveling up the aesthetic
[02:25] quality with a midjourney partnership
[02:26] might not hurt. The other question is
[02:28] whether the deal arises out of a failed
[02:30] Aquaire attempt. It was already reported
[02:32] that Meta had attempted to buy out gen
[02:34] video startup Runway. So, we know
[02:35] they've had their sights on various AI
[02:37] multimedia companies. The partnership,
[02:39] however, suggests that Meta isn't just
[02:41] looking for talent, but also trying to
[02:42] get their hand on the best tech to build
[02:44] visual AI products. Responses really run
[02:46] the gamut. Some saw this as a knock on
[02:48] Meta Scale. AI commenter Spore writes,
[02:50] "Midejourney is phenomenal, and this is
[02:52] a great partnership for both parties,
[02:54] but man, another point in favor of being
[02:55] bearish on Meta." Gaming startup founder
[02:58] Assad Dar suggested instead though that
[03:00] the move was more about urgency,
[03:01] commenting, "Meta licensing midjourney
[03:03] tech is smart. Creative AI is still
[03:05] undervalued, but it's going to define
[03:07] how we share, market, and communicate
[03:09] online. Tony Wong thought it was an
[03:11] example of the natural evolution of
[03:13] platforms. He wrote, "Meta plus
[03:15] midjourney equals platforms now
[03:16] outsourced taste itself." We've seen
[03:18] this playbook before. Spotify didn't
[03:20] just stream music, they algorithmic
[03:22] musical discovery. Netflix didn't just
[03:24] host shows, they became the curator of
[03:26] what stories get told. Tik Tok didn't
[03:28] just show videos, they rewired attention
[03:29] spans. Now Meta embeds AI taste into the
[03:32] infrastructure. Like all things with AI,
[03:35] this is basically a roar shack test on
[03:36] how you feel about AI and the companies
[03:38] involved. So whether this is making AI
[03:40] slop look prettier or an example of how
[03:42] Zuckerberg comes back swinging when his
[03:44] back is against the wall is mostly going
[03:45] to be in the eye of the beholder. One
[03:48] other story about Meta, however, the
[03:50] company is upsizing their infrastructure
[03:51] through a $10 billion cloud deal with
[03:53] Google. Sources speaking with the
[03:55] information say that the two tech giants
[03:56] have agreed to a six-year deal that will
[03:58] see Meta spend more than $10 billion.
[04:00] Though sources said that the deal
[04:02] largely relates to Meta securing their
[04:03] AI inference needs. Now this month has
[04:06] seen Meta shuffle around their data
[04:07] center plans as they figure out how to
[04:09] fund one of the most ambitious buildouts
[04:11] in the industry. The company has
[04:12] forecast around 70 billion in capex this
[04:14] year and another big increase in 2026.
[04:17] Earlier this week, it was reported that
[04:18] Meta had closed a $29 billion private
[04:20] credit deal, marking an interesting
[04:22] shift from big tech firms self-
[04:24] financing their infrastructure buildout.
[04:26] And now we have Meta positioning
[04:27] themselves as a large renter of
[04:28] inference as well as a data center
[04:30] operator in their own right. Meta also
[04:32] has agreements in place with Amazon and
[04:33] Microsoft. But the Google deal is a
[04:35] significant jump in capacity. Now
[04:37] ultimately this makes sense. When
[04:38] Zuckerberg was out recruiting the super
[04:40] intelligence team, he made a big point
[04:41] that the best talent wants access to
[04:43] unconstrained compute. Ever since then,
[04:45] Meta's move seemed designed to set up
[04:47] near infinite resources for their big AI
[04:49] push.
[04:50] News from another major player in the
[04:52] foundation model game XAI. The company
[04:54] has officially open sourced Grock 2.5.
[04:57] The model, which is now two generations
[04:59] behind, has become available on
[05:00] HuggingFace. Elon Musk said that the
[05:03] previous generation model Gro 3 will be
[05:05] available in around 6 months. The
[05:07] release gives us the first opportunity
[05:08] to examine Grock's architecture. The
[05:10] model has 268 billion parameters
[05:12] arranged in a mixture of experts design
[05:14] with eight total experts and two active
[05:16] at a time. It has a maximum of 131,000
[05:18] tokens of context. Interestingly, AI
[05:21] engineer Tim Kellogg criticized the
[05:22] release, noting that the custom license
[05:24] has some anti-competitive terms. He
[05:26] queried, "Why did it take so long to
[05:28] open this up? There's nothing
[05:29] interesting here." Now, to the extent
[05:31] that there is something interesting for
[05:33] some, it's really just XAI setting the
[05:35] tone by deprecating their old models
[05:36] into the open source world. AI
[05:38] researcher Sebastian Rashka commented,
[05:40] "It's quite cool that the open source
[05:41] community gets the real full-size model
[05:43] that was used in production as opposed
[05:45] to the light or spin-off version."
[05:47] Separately, Elon Musk has announced
[05:48] plans to launch an AI software company
[05:50] called Macrohard. Aside from enjoying
[05:52] the pun relative to Microsoft, Musk
[05:55] commented, "In principle, given that
[05:56] software companies like Microsoft do not
[05:58] themselves manufacture any physical
[06:00] hardware, it should be possible to
[06:01] simulate them entirely with AI. We'll
[06:04] see whether anything comes of it, but
[06:05] the idea does echo OpenAI's concept of
[06:07] level 5 agents that are capable of doing
[06:09] all the work of an organization."
[06:11] Lastly today, a fundraising update from
[06:13] Anthropic. The company is nearing a deal
[06:15] to raise up to $10 billion in a
[06:17] jumbosized round. The last reporting on
[06:19] the rumored term suggests Anthropic was
[06:21] looking to take in 5 billion at a $170
[06:23] billion valuation. So, in a matter of a
[06:26] few weeks, Anthropic has doubled their
[06:27] target and apparently had no trouble at
[06:29] all filling the round. Bloomberg reports
[06:31] that Iconic Capital is leading the round
[06:33] with firms including TPG, Lightseed
[06:35] Venture Partners, Spark Capital, and
[06:36] Menllo Ventures participating. The
[06:38] Carter Investment Authority and the
[06:40] Government of Singapore Investment
[06:41] Corporation have also reportedly
[06:42] participated in talks as Enthropic opens
[06:44] their cap table to sovereign wealth
[06:45] funds for the first time. Now, if you're
[06:47] keeping track, this seems to be the
[06:49] round where Enthropic grows beyond the
[06:50] capacity of traditional venture capital.
[06:52] They'll come close to tripling the $61.5
[06:55] billion valuation they achieved at their
[06:56] last round in March and have also
[06:58] tripled the scale of fundraising for
[06:59] this particular round. At this rate,
[07:02] Anthropic will overtake OpenAI is the
[07:04] most valuable AI lab in a year. And
[07:06] Benedict pointing out the public market
[07:08] appetite said, "If Anthropic IPOed, it
[07:10] would rip straight to 500 billion."
[07:13] Indeed. And by the way, I think that is
[07:14] an arbitrage that people are not taking
[07:16] enough advantage of, but that is a topic
[07:18] for another day. For now, that's going
[07:20] to do it for today's AI daily brief
[07:21] headlines. Next up, the main
