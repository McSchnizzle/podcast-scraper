Yo, this is an advertisement. Douglas Rushkoff has entered the world of commerce. Both because someone has finally seen fit to sponsor a cantankerous anti-establishment neo-hippie Gen Xer, and because I finally found a company worthy of the Team Human Oompa. Everyone's Earth, maker of Kobe Dryer Sheets, is as obsessed with environmental sustainability as we are and using less unfriendly energy consumption in a week of operations than we are in recording a single vodcast in this air-conditioned studio. They've thought of everything in their supply chain from labor and energy to biodegradability and marketing. That's why they're promoting us. So go to kobedryersheets.com and get yourself some of these puppies with a 10% discount by typing in the code Rush10. That's Rush10. End of advertisement. You're on Team Human Conscious Intervention in the Machine. A chance to tap into the essential energies that animate this whole show. Leave the intellectualism behind and open to the Eros. Yeah, you got that right. We're graduating from middle school now for an intergenerational talk about sex. I'm Douglas Rushkoff, and I'm on Team Human. Playing for Team Human today, writer, editor, and founder of PleasureSeeking.com and host of the Pleasure Seeking podcast, Camille Sohit Pesha. Camille and I are going to talk about her recent trend forecast, The Future of Fucking, how sex has become a new subversion, ethical dating in 2025, and what the heck is going on out there. So strap in or strap on. It's time to intervene on behalf of people and all sensuous beings. I'm Douglas Rushkoff, and you're on Team Human. Thank you for having me. Oh my god, thanks for being here. I got so much I want to speak with you about. And although I know you're New York Times published and written about, you know, expert in these things, I also understand you're a person. Thank you. Thank you. Bravely, I persist. Exactly, you do. But all opinions expressed here, you know, may or may not be. Right, it's not official. You're a human alive in this. I mean, that's the way I perceive your work. You're a human alive, open to this time, and actively, intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually metabolizing what's happening and narrating it in real time. That's the goal. Yeah, absolutely. Which is nice, rather than like, oh, the Mom's Venus serial thing. I can't do the ivory tower thing. That's like kind of what I wanted to give an alternative to in the way that I approach sex reporting, because I'm like, so much of online dialogue around sex feels like it's really online in like a touch grass type of way. Like you need to be out there and like see what's really happening instead of just talking about whatever's trending on TikTok. And so, yeah, I like to be on the streets and talking about what I'm seeing from my perspective. I know, and I was, I was off the streets or, you know, out of circulation for 20 years or so. So, and when I went into whatever I was in 25 years ago, the world of sex was, at least to me, my eyes, very different than it is today. Which is sort of what the first thing I kind of want to get a sense of is what the heck is going on out there. For the most part, it seems really good. You know, when I was dating, it was so much about it was about everyone was looking for the person to be. And even sex and dating was a means to an end. Like the person, like their person, soulmate type of vibe? Yeah, like I'm dating in order to find the right person. And it's like, are we having sex in order to connect as people? Are we having sex to try each other out for some parents on average when there's not going to be sex or something? This whole other thing's going to happen. And, you know, I came out into this world and it felt in some ways like coming out, you know, into this as a sexual being with, you know, polyamory and enthusiastic consent and serial non-monogamy and ethical non-monogamy and all these different, you know, trying to figure out what the hell even am I? Is there such a thing as just single anymore? So that's a very like Carrie Bradshawism. Like, I couldn't help but wonder. Is there such a thing? As being single in the city. Right. I mean, there's definitely you can have sex in the city, but I go out there and I'm wondering, and I know I read these dire reports, oh, there's no sex, nobody's having sex, and all that. And I walk around the East Village, and I'm like, oh, my God, this is the sexiest scene I've ever freaking seen in my life. People are fucking over there. Like, when you walk around at night, I walk around on like a Saturday night. I'm like, oh, wow. Like, I had that experience recently after, actually, after seeing, you know, Candace Bushnell, who wrote Sex in the City? I saw her one woman's show. She was like talking about how kind of like everything's changed and New York is dead. And then I was walking from that show to my next destination. I walked through the village and I was just walking around Lower East Side and I was like, oh, no, it's not. Like, people are fucking. People are out on a Saturday night. It's interesting. So, I mean, I met you at Alec Kazemi's. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I introduced myself because I read your book. But it was interesting. So that party, in some ways, was a turning point for me, because I mean, I saw, I mean, I guess we can call them Gen Z, but they weren't all Gen Z. There's millennials there, too. But I saw this, like, wow, you know, Trump is president, the world is ending, Gaza's happening, there's all these things. And people are out partying. And, you know, there was some girls with blood on their face and guys all dressed as sort of 70s porn stars with all the little mustaches and things. Everybody's smoking cigarettes. And I was just thinking, wow, this is a different, people are celebrating. I don't, I mean, celebrating something, hopefully not Trump. But I think... We're not celebrating Trump, but almost like, look, if this is going down, we're going to party. We have to live, yeah. I mean, I think it's, it's interesting how that, I guess it kind of reflects what we wanted to talk about with the trend report, where I think that when the political climate is so dire and we're seeing all of these like headlines that just make us want to crawl into a hole, like there is some antidote in going out and being with people, and like there's positive hedonism and negative hedonism. You can totally forget about what's happening in the world and totally disengage and just party, or it can be this space where you can like be in touch with what it means to be alive and not just be totally overwhelmed, you know? Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, to bookend it to a moment you probably weren't alive for, 9-11 happened in New York. I was alive. You were alive, but I wasn't in New York. Yeah. Well, 9-11 happened, and it's like everyone partnered up. It's like a ton of people got married and had kids and did all that, and some of the had some, there's some instinctual reason why people do that. But it feels like in this moment, it's not people getting married and having kids so much as just getting out there and soaking up some fun, maybe. Yeah. I heard a crazy statistic. This is a bit of a segue, but I heard a crazy statistic from someone I met on the street who just started talking to me about this. But I guess at some point, I don't know what time period this would be, she had this anecdote from this historian named Boswell about how when there were beheadings, like in a village, everyone would fuck afterward. And the sort of relationship between like the threat of death and the life-affirming kind of act of sex that I thought was interesting. We were talking about the TV show dying for sex, and that's how it came up. But it's like when you're kind of facing death from all sides or this idea of destruction, like you know, climate, political, whatever, like, it makes sense to want to like reach out and touch someone and have some like real connecting experience, you know? Like, you're like, I'm here. Right. And it's not always, I mean, you know, sex is part of it, but it's really just, I mean, we're so missing it in our culture. You know, I remember when I went to Italy, I was like 19, and I saw all these guys like holding each other walking down the street in Spain. And it's like, and they're not, I mean, maybe they were fucking, but for the most part, they're not. They're just, it was part of it. And this whole, it's funny, that the next book I kind of want to write is called Advanced Spooning. And I wonder if I've heard of that subtitle for beginners. But that spooning is like the key to everything. I'm like, there needs to be, you get happy wife, happy life. What are we going to do for spooning? Like, what's the phrase? We're going to work on it. Right. Right. But it does fix a lot of things. It does, but it's like, it's that. It's that reaching out. I mean, I'm going to a lot of kind of ecstatic dance things, which are really sweet, both teeny ones and giant ones. And just people together in spaces. It feels like it's kind of what's called for. Yeah. And this weird, alienated moment that we're in. I mean, community is like, I feel like it's one of the few things that we can't have for free, you know? You would think. You would think. I mean, in New York, but like. Two drink minimum. Right. But how did you get if if you have a journey story, how did you get here to a place where you're, I mean, ostensibly giving like sex advice on a podcast, you know, on a vodcast. On a vodcast. To to many people. I mean, you didn't, like, s study sex. I actually did. You did. But kind of by accident, I didn't plan to be in this field at all. But in retrospect, it kind of makes sense. I went to one of those schools, Sarah Lawrence, where you kind of create your own major. And I studied a lot of different things, but some of it I was going to be in psychology. So I was at one point doing like research studies actually on sexuality and studying like sex and gender dynamics and the sort of anthropology of it and also the philosophy of desire and sexuality. So I had like a funny little like, I guess I didn't plan to be in this at all. I thought I was going to be in the art world and I was for some time until I pivoted to become a writer. But in retrospect, you look back at it and you're like, oh, like this was a core interest that I didn't know how to channel into like a creative field. But like I was always interested in learning about this stuff and always thinking about this stuff. So it kind of makes sense now, but I've it was an accident that it emerged, you know, in my professional life. And then when did when did it pivot kind of from writing, writing? Because I mean, I remember the moment I pivoted from kind of writing about pop culture and all to like, oh, now I'm writing about the net. And all of a sudden I'm an accidental net expert. Totally, totally. Yeah. I um I was working in magazines for a long time. I was at Document Journal and I was writing as well as editing and I started doing, I think because I have a lot of friends in like the sex work and performance community, like I started doing some reporting on issues that I was seeing take shape there, like around sex workers' rights and the internet and technology and things like that. And it sort of led me down a rabbit hole where I started as a reporter going into these worlds and kind of wanting to translate some of the things that friends and communities that matter to me were experiencing and that were really invisible to the outside world. Things like, you know, how credit card companies regulate online porn and how shadow banning works and affects people and how why sex workers can't have bank accounts and all of these like things that are affecting a portion of the population that doesn't always have a voice in mainstream media. And so like I would learn these kind of crazy things like you can't have period blood in porn and the reason is Visa MasterCard. And then I'd be like, what? And like go down that rabbit hole. What is that? Because of the occult power? They're afraid. They're not ready for it. It's because there's like a kind of funny situation where the like the choke point, I think they call it, of payment processors determine what you can sell. So if like Visa MasterCard is like, we can't have you selling, say there's reasons that you couldn't sell a video that say it's abusive or it's like in some way crossing a line that they don't stand with people being able to pay for that kind of porn. The problem is that with like kind of Christian organizations lobbying for what's what you can or cannot depict, Visa MasterCard does not want to like stand with a lot of things that actually aren't harmful. And there's a really like vague and strange way of moderating online porn that becomes like there's like a list of things that can get you taken down, but they don't publicize the list. So people have to kind of play the guessing game and a lot of content gets taken down like you can't say like I think at the time I was talking to someone on OnlyFans, about how she couldn't even like say cervix or say that she's on her period and that's why she can't do this or film porn that involved period blood because blood is banned because it could be violence, but also it's obviously menstruation. There's all these weird things, like you can't do a bondage scene without one hand free. Wow. There's all this. Right, I mean, but this used to be like television sensors that you couldn't like have two hands. It used to be Hayes code, yeah, yeah, yeah. One foot on the ground or something. It's like that, though, but that also dictates porn. Like you, there's a reason that there's not a lot of hypnosis porn is there was a lot of like at one point credit card chargebacks, people being like, oh, I was hypnotized. That's why I spent all that money online. And the credit card companies are like, we can't have that. But the interesting thing is it's not some legal. No, it's not the law. I've talked to lawyers about it. It's private companies determining the flow of commerce and then the adult industry responding to that because they're not going to make stuff they can't sell. That's kind of heavy though. It's interesting, yeah. But it's like, it's crazy how it affects people who are like, oh, I can't run my business one week out of the month because I'm bleeding. You know, that's like a crazy thing. Right. When there's probably a whole segment of that. There's a huge segment of people who would love that. Yeah, totally. Yeah, it's kind of fascinating. But stuff like that that you just hear about through people who experience it, but there's not a lot of, like, there actually was the Financial Times did some interesting reporting on this, but there's not a lot of information out there and it's kind of niche knowledge. And I got interested in those things and like following those rabbit holes. And then I didn't start writing about sex from the personal perspective kind of until quite recently, like a year or two. Ago, more than a year ago, I was offered a magazine column and it was sort of like, okay, like, what am I gonna do? Like, if I'm putting myself in the situation, I've always been like going to these crazy parties and like putting myself in these situations just because I'm sort of interested in it. And then I was like, I think it gave me permission to take my own thoughts and experiences seriously and include those in the piece as well as sort of reporting on things that I thought were like important, you know? And I think like what I really respond to in other people's work often is these sort of personal narratives, like things that are close to the bone and that are like hard to write about, but you take a chance and a bunch of people are like, oh, I had that experience too. So I tried to kind of go toward what scared me. The first really personal column I wrote was about my obsession with my ex-boyfriend's ex-girlfriend and like how we ended up. I had what I thought was a very creepy obsession for a long time with like, I would like stalk her on social media and stuff. Long story short, we ended up her, one of my exes exes confessed that they had a crush on me and had for many, many years. And I had been stalking her on the internet this whole time. So I was like, wow, it's mutual. So there was like, it began this investigative piece. I interviewed my exes exes and like did this sort of participatory journalistic thing where it was like starting with my obsession to actually understanding how it was mutual and how for both of us it was actually a kind of was not about jealousy it was actually about kind of having a crush on each other and that sort of as a queer awakening yeah I mean it was like it what was crazy to me is I thought it was this one-sided thing this whole time and then this person sent me this kind of crazy text confessing like a seven-year crush and I was like what like I thought the whole time that I was completely alone in this experience. But actually, it was like a two-way street. So I thought, okay, maybe more people are having this experience. Like, maybe more people, you know, are obsessed with their experience. You hear about the jealousy of stalking people on Instagram. You know, it's a huge part of the world now. But like, for me, it wasn't just jealousy. I just kind of got parasocially fond of these women where I was like, first I was stalking them and then I was like, you know what? They're great. You know, what are they up to? And I feel like. So your ex has a good choice in women. Yeah, great taste in women. And ultimately, I mean, I liked them better than I liked the ex. But I ended up writing about that. It was pretty personal and it was like, I think, pretty exposing in a certain way that had a lot of people messaging me being like, I do this. And a lot of people came forward and were like, oh, like, I thought I was the only one who did this. And that to me was a taste of like, it's worth putting yourself out there if it gives other people permission to talk about something that they thought they were completely alone in. So for me, that was kind of a high to be able to connect with also all the amazing bisexual women of the internet. It was like a perfect honeypot. All these women messaged me being like, I too am bisexual and stalk my ex's ex. I was like, wow, that's so great. We should get drinks. You don't need an app. You are the app. Yeah, right, seriously. But that was how I started writing more personally. And then I did like another big piece about going to this very expensive sex party. That's like. Oh, no, not me. I loopholed it. But it's like all men, I think, have to pay upward of $12,000. To go to a party? Yeah, it's like for me. You have to be a member, and it's like this whole thing. And there is a loophole for women who go through the interview process and are like adding to the vibe, basically. Right, if they're hot. So I was basically loopholed it. Yeah, exactly. But I was there, like, really as a voyeur investigating it, talking to the owner, stuff like that, and doing kind of a like, what's a fly on the wall at the most expensive sex party? Is it actually cool? What's happening? Was there a sex party in the sex party or did people just take them home? Oh no, people were having sex, definitely. Like it was definitely a it's like based on eyes wide shut. It's a very active like people were having sex, but but it didn't really feel sexy to me. Like it felt like a bit of a death of culture thing where I was like, all these people are paying so much to have this like transgressive experience where they feel like they can be free and experience this like side of themselves. But at the same time, a bunch of people in a room who are rich paying to have this like free space does not always create the best vibe. I mean when I heard when I heard it, it sounded to me like, oh, that this is a way, if men are paying $12,000 each to be there, then it's a way for the women who were there to know these are pre-qualified millionaire people. Right. I mean, I think that's probably like a big utility of it of why I have to imagine the other women were there. It's not like the women are paying to get in other than couples. Well, I'm sure there are some female members, but it's like I was just like when I was invited to it, I was like, I feel like I have a duty to go and see what's up, because like it's not that easy to get into these things. And so like that's been my approach usually. When I get a crazy invite, I'm like, I have to go. Like, I was invited out to this brothel in Nevada a few, I guess it was like over a month ago now, for this like Roman Empire-themed party that they were having there for the like for the women and their dates and this like sort of there was a crazy murder mystery element. I got this email and I was like, signed, sealed, and delivered. Like, send me to Nevada, I am going there. Like, I am immediately, like, put me in the mix because that sounds like a wild room to be in. And I found that really fun because I think it's like there are a lot of amazing theorists and a lot of amazing reporters. And I think where I excel is being willing to just throw myself into a situation, and that's something that I can, like, I don't know what it is about my personality that I'm willing to do this. Yeah, but I'm like, I really kind of like love being in a ridiculous situation. And I think a lot of people would like to know what's going on there, but they don't want to do it themselves, you know? Well, when you say ridiculous, do you mean potentially dangerous? Like, that you? I mean, I think I'm not, I probably should be more worried about that. I realize that even the people at the brothel, which was very safe, were like, girl, you came here alone, you know? Because it's like an hour and a half from Vegas. You like drive into the night in a black car. But for better or worse, I think I have like a pretty high like confidence in other people. And like, it's not necessarily dangerous, but more socially uncomfortable, I think. Like, I'm willing to throw myself into situations like that where it's like being in this room. Yeah, I'm like, surely, like, this is not going to be the hardest thing for me to face. Like, I think it's an interesting story. It's a hilarious story if it goes wrong or if it goes right. So. Oh, yeah. I mean, and that was sort of, that's where I was in the 90s of early cyber cultures. It's like, oh, so there's a group of people going to sit around and do DMT while looking at fractal generated files. I want to hear more about this. Yeah, it's wild. I mean, the interesting thing was the, for the most part, that scene was not so sexual. It was sort of nerds getting into sort of psychedelic, out-of-body, you know, contact whatever. But it wasn't, it didn't have, in England it did, but in America, it didn't have that earthy connection back to the back to the real. It's kind of stayed, you know. What do you think about like how sex and the internet evolved? I feel like there was such a utopian idea early on about how the internet would, you know, shape sexual expression. And we're facing sort of. You know, it's like all the part about how we're going to be honest about who we are. You can be a dog, I could be a woman in a mud and pretend I'm this and whatever. For all that, a lot of it was really more about like teledildonics, you know, like, oh, we're going to strap this thing on here and then she'll be in another city and strap that thing on there. And you know, things will vibrate and haptics. And it always seemed more about, oh, can't we just fuck? You know, or we're going to have 3D porn virtual blah, blah, blah. It was like, if you see it exactly in this position, it's going to look like she's doing something to you. And it's like, yeah, it was part for me, it was almost part of the dead end of the net itself that we used it for the opposite of what we could have. What would be your dream for how it could be used, like, I guess, in regards to sexuality? So here's so much about like kind of, I think there was a seed of thought at that time of like it, like you said, this free space for like kind of expression and finding of other people in like niche communities or subcultures, like that you were like able to be whoever on the internet. I would think it's, you know, and it's also to practice. You know, if I want to feel what it's like to be gay or this, I'm afraid to actually go do it. You just go into a gay room and be there and hear what people do. And, you know, the beauty of the net was, honestly, was that you could lie. That was the good thing. It was a play space. You know, and once I remember when they started to put banking on there, I was like, no, don't do that. Because now the whole thing's going to have to get grounded in reality and verification. It was a place where you could be anybody. But now there are, I've been to a couple, there's experience, places I can go and be anybody to. And it's like, on one hand, I feel like we're in Berlin 1925, that this is, you know, house of yes and this and that, you know, the stranger parties that'll happen where anybody can be anything and you wear fetish things and you try this and try that. But then it's like, do you feel like we're, this is this newfound experiential fetishistic nightlife scene is, you know, whatever they call it, end of the day. The cycle, or do you feel it's the birth of of something positive? You know, I keep worrying it's like a, you know, what was that? Babylon show, you know? Wait, do you mean what is that? Well, is it are are we are we birthing something new, a genuinely liberating, healthy, I mean, some of the stuff I've been doing, I went and did this thing called Liquid Love. Have you heard of that? No. Basically, people like lie on this big I mean, it sounds gross, but it isn't. Um, maybe it is. They just have like coconut oil and people, and everybody kind of just touching each other. But these these new ways of experiencing each other, new kinds of parties, where, yeah, where people are having sex at this party. What is that? I mean, it can be gross, but it could also be like yeah, I would argue that it's not necessarily new, right? People have been having sex parties, though. I think there's a bit of a resurgence in interest in it lately. I heard it described in quite an interesting way, actually, talking to someone last night about why so many people they know are going to sex parties, not just for freedom of expression, but because it's like in a life that is so scheduled in, it's like, oh, here's a place that I can go to express this part of my identity. You know, like, oh, here's like a place in a way. And I thought yesterday I was also talking to the madam of the brothel of Sherry's, and she's she's an amazing woman, Dina. Um, but we were talking about the trend she's witnessed within this like very famous like 50-year-old brothel, and she's saying a lot of they were seeing an upswing of female clients, usually like really ambitious business women who are like, Oh, I go to the brothel to like experience this side of my sexuality, and the rest of the time I'm kind of like busy. And I think that kind of those things link together in my head of like, what if you're not just going to a sex party to like I guess expand the boundaries of what you want? Maybe that's just the place that you go now to like experience sexuality if it's like not really integrated in the other parts of your life. I don't know. Go to church on Sunday. Yeah, you go to the sex party. Yeah, I mean it's it's kind of wild to think of that way because that also wouldn't be my like I like going to sex party but that wouldn't be my first choice for like this is the easy way to do it. But I'd rather life be a sex party. Right, right. I prefer that sort of less constrained approach but but I think that that was true for the people paying for this particular sex party is they're like, oh, here's the place where I can like go wild and have this free space where like one, it was super discreet. Like the big thing that they're paying for is if they're famous or high profile is everyone checks their phones. No one can in any way like you get booted from the club if you talk about it. Even the own owner of the club got booted from the club for talking about it. So it's like I think people are seeking a place that they can freely express without worrying about like internet surveillance or like being canceled or having it. Do you know like maybe the in-person is what the web used to be where you used to be able to be online and be anyone and not have it traced to you. Now it's all traced online and I think maybe people are seeking in person places where they can be anonymous and that's the fun thing isn't it? Yeah. It is. We used to use the internet as this right this sort of secret club place we'd go. It had a barrier to entry, and you'd be there. And now it's like everybody and Musk or whoever are up there. But I feel like, oh, so let's just take back the real world. Totally. You go take the world. Yeah, I think we need to have a real world coup. You can have the net, if I can have the East Village, right? Totally. My God. So you also mentioned a couple of times, you mentioned like sex work. And it seems to me there's been kind of a blurring of the line between sex work and I don't even know what to call them, quid pro quo relationships. There have been a couple of people I've spoken to who are like working on an art project or we're trying to get together a thing, you know, and then it gets dropped in as, well, one way you could support our work is on doing some basically sex work to support our wait who's saying this? Like young women to me. Uh-huh. They're saying you should do sex work? No, that they do sex work. In other words, it's sort of like a seeking arrangement. Oh, you're over 50 and I'm under 30 and whatever and I'm supporting my art project and one way that you can make a type of patron deal with you? Yeah. Uh-huh. I mean, definitely that economy has like sort of shifted with the like popularization of OnlyFans and of like more wide acceptance of sex work and then like you're saying. The blurring of the lines where I think there's a funny thing happening where sex work used to be like untouchable and now a lot of people, even if they don't identify as sex workers, are talking about being a high-value woman in a relationship with a man who's gonna pay for their lifestyle. This whole like stay-at-home girlfriend thing versus like that used to be like sugar baby, you know? It's all been very rebranded and also like repositioned as sort of like empowering to it's almost like everybody's almost like demanding money from men now has become repositioned as a way of like respecting yourself and your value. Where in the past I think it used to be more stigmatized and shame for like selling access to you or something like this. And like in some ways I think it's positive because obviously the stigma that affects sex work is like, I mean it really affects sex workers lives in a huge way. In another way it's kind of funny. It's like almost like whitewashing it or something where now there's all these girls on TikTok being like, and this is how to get him to, you know, spend all this money on you or like, oh, I would dump him if he wasn't a provider. Or did you see the movie The Materialists? Kind of crazy movie. I'm not going to say it's a good movie, but it's kind of about this of like there's sort of warring cultural themes of like, should you date for money or love? which I think is really present in the dating environment now. And it's become more a part of the dating environment that's not even like viewed as commerce in the way that it also like functions as you know. Does that make sense? Yeah. No, I was talking about it with one of these women and she was like, well, you know, you could date someone and you could spend, you know, $200 on a dinner and this and that and then you've got to do a trip and all that. I'm just, you know, it's the same, except I want the money directly. Yeah, yeah. And so she was saying she does like, does it in more of a sex work way versus like having this relationship that is also financial funding. Right. Yeah. I mean, I think in some ways there's like a there's a good clarity in that. Like I'm very pro sex work and sex workers' rights. But I think it's really interesting the way that people have repackaged sort of the same activity as not sex work and as like normal dating and as this just like it's it's really interesting to me. At the same time, I feel like some sex workers are becoming more like influencers. Like it's becoming more accepted and becoming kind of inseparable from the Tradwife thing to me where it's like we've almost circled back to where now people think that being supported by a man is revolutionary and saying like fuck you to the system because it's saying fuck you to capitalism. You don't have to work maybe, but it's not like structurally revolutionary to depend on a man for funds, you know? But I think it's a sign of how bad the economic system is in the job market that it's like the best case scenario is to have a rich husband now, you know? That was what I was thinking, you know, to see all these, you know, all these, I don't know the numbers, I don't really have research, but to see what seems like a preponderance of young women and Gen Z involved in like seeking arrangement type things, it seemed to me to be more an economic indicator than anything else. I mean, jobs are going away faster than anything. And this is the oldest one in the books. It's like, it's kind of wild. I've even experienced this: of like, it's wild to be like, you can work so long in a career field, and still, it's extremely more lucrative to be like a hot girl on the internet. You know, like it's the access to upward mobility through this type of work is completely different than other fields. Even interviewing, like, I interviewed a lot of the courtesans at the brothel about why they got into it, and they had all these like wide range of backgrounds from like PhD students to like former nurses, like people with a huge range of former careers. But this is the one that allows them to make life-changing money in a short period of time. And it's like, as the job market changes, like there aren't a lot of things that are a sure bet. The path to success that we used to be sold has been totally sideswiped. And it's like, yeah, I guess like it is a kind of very tantalizing option, you know? Yeah. Like it, it's there's not a lot of alternatives that are just ready-made and available. You don't just get to get a job because you went to college or something. It's like extremely stiff competition to get a job in your field, you know? Yeah, I was funny. The only equivalent I ever really had that I could fall back on was helping rich people get their children into Ivy League colleges. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's a good one. I need to do that. Anything for that. SATs, college applications, and all. Money is just you can. You're pimping out your brain. Yeah, but you reveal it slowly, and there's always some other layer of help. Well, if you really wanted to go that way, we could talk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow, you're making it. I'm like, guys, I'm available.

But now with the pleasure seeking, of course, the millions that are coming in not views, definitely money. Well, so there was one thing when you were talking in the future of fucking survey, I guess we can call it, or study, which people should go look up at at pleasure seeking.com. It's pleasure dash seeking, because despite my millions, I haven't ponied up for the domain name without the dash. Oh my god. There was once where you said with the political landscape growing darker, sex is starting to feel subversive again. Rather than a neatly packaged empowerment narrative, we're seeing a return to transgressive, messy, unapologetic sexuality. One that's less palatable and more perverse. I hope this is me manifesting. Is it? But I think, like, I mean, do you have a question about it, or should I just launch into it? Like, there was a sort of interesting moment with sex positivity and feminism. When I was kind of coming up, I think it was really cool to be like, like, basically, sexuality was suddenly framed not as degrading for women, but as liberating. And there was this sort of like pro-SLET narrative of like, go forth and like experience pleasure, while at the same time, the orgasm gap had not been closed. A lot of women were going out there having casual sex, thinking I'm going to feel empowered, and coming away, not even, they're not even coming, first of all. And this guy's going to ghost them. It's like the environment became sort of like, I think there was this sort of false dream of empowerment that was sold to women before we were really there in the way that the sexual culture was functioning. And then I think a lot of people got like around the same time, dating apps became very popular. There was like suddenly massive access to this like new hookup culture. And a lot of brands, I think, were kind of angling for their slice of the pie. Like everyone wants to sell empowerment to women. It's like, you know, sexual empowerment became almost like part of being a feminist. Like you're supposed to be empowered and be sexually liberated and everything like this. And I think a lot of people got soured on it from having a lot of bad experiences they thought were going to be empowering and actually coming into contact with the systems and the powers that be and that hadn't really shifted so much as much as we wanted to say. You know, there's it's like it might be less stigmatized, but it doesn't mean that men are now good at sex or that like the dating environment is very fun to be a part of. And I think that's why we saw this like backlash of like both sort of a trad wife vibe. I think something similar happened with the workplace of the girl boss narrative of being like, come in and conquer and woman who has it all, but then women realized it was really exhausting to have it all and still be doing more at home statistically. Like there's still the chore gap and there's still the pay gap and all this stuff. I basically think there was this cultural like we've seen the pendulum shift toward conservatism and I think it's partially because there was this false dream that was sold to people and then people realized people especially women that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be this like sexual empowerment or empowerment in the workplace and swung the other direction and I think like now as we're in this more oppressive climate and as like our rights are actually being stripped away I think sex and sexual expression starts to feel more subversive and transgressive again. You're not just like it's hard to feel like you're doing something transgressive, naughty, and sexy when you're on a dating app being prompted by Hinge and the tech billionaires that run it to send someone a rose. You're not like, I'm being so bad right now. You know, like I'm curious about your experience, but I imagine. Earlier generations growing up, you know, you're not supposed to be having sex. It's kind of forbidden, fun, all this. Suddenly, we kind of were supposed to. And there's like the sex recession, there's all these dating apps. It's like almost becomes another area of your life that you have to handle and optimize. Right. And then you're almost questioned about it. Like, are you doing it enough? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Can you think of anything less sexy? Yeah. I mean, for me, my strategy, if we can even call it that, my approach has been to put it in the same kind of category as psychedelics or ecstatic experience or spirituality. That it's like, and no, it's not always going to be spiritual. Sometimes it's going to be something else. That's just, you know, I don't think about my ice cream consumption either. It's like every once in a while ice cream shows up and is eaten. Yeah. You know, but that's not, that's, that's, that's happenstance. But it's like, you know, I guess I'm a hippie rave idealist when it comes down to it, but I want, you know, shared orgasms of bliss that are simultaneously healing the planet of its trauma. Once you figure it out, let me know. I'm working on it. Let's put our minds together. Yeah, this is going to be it. Yeah, yeah. It can only be shown. I'm sorry. It can't be transmitted by you. You guys know where to go. No, but as that, as that, you know, and that's why I'm looking at this, the sexuality of the East Village now feels like, oh, you know, tonight we dance, but tomorrow we die. You know, there's that sort of, there's a desperate to it. I mean, I'd rather them be do it than not, you know, dance on the deck of the Titanic as it goes down. And that's something. I don't know, like, in a way, I think it's healthy if it pushes people to connect with each other and have like a real experience. On the other hand, yeah, there is something kind of dire about this almost like last hurrah vibe of like, yeah, we're like, we have to live in the now. I mean, I think of even like the attitude toward like there was like a confluence of stories, I think, at some point around Gen Z smoking and stuff like that. And it's like, what are we, what are we staying healthy for? You know, sort of this like do this day thing. And it's like, well, you have to live in the now because tomorrow is not certain. It's feeling less certain than ever. But at the same time, how do we balance that with like doing the things that actually would create a better tomorrow? And that is now focused. So smoking isn't necessarily now focused. Smoking, the experience of smoking for me is very much about creating a linear unit of time. If you're really in the now, you're breathing. When you're smoking, it's so you get, oh, this is a six-minute line. So, no, you're not in the now. It's like, oh, you're thinking about your next cigarette, you know, or you're recovering from the last one. But the now is the thing that for me, that's the power of sex. And this might, again, this might be the old person sex, but is the slowing it down? Is the just be there, be there now, which I find people, some people can't or won't do. They're gonna go toward the thing. And it's like, well, just be there. And then that's the opportunity of even the frenetic community thing that's happening around now. It's like, okay, we're all bouncing into each other at Joyface or something. But you can, even in a, Joyface is this, is this club on Avenue C, a type bar, basically, where people are dancing to 70s music. And like Gen Z's, Gen Y's, Gen X's, we're all there dancing. And you can, even in that frenzy of post-apocalyptic fear, you can experience like when the cameras, when the film slows down and you're just in there, you can have that extended moment. So I'm hopeful that even in its frantic intensity, that these deeply social, they give people that moment to go, wow, I'm sitting on St. Mark's place, it's closed, and there's all these people, and yeah, they're NYU students. I'm so we're here. Totally. I mean, I think that is a power of partying and of nightlife. I think Sophia Giovanni put it in an amazing way in her book, Working Girl, which is like a memoir of sex work and theory. It's also really a critical theory book. But this was not explicitly in regards to partying. But she talked about carving out these spaces outside of empire time. And it's kind of these spaces outside of like the capitalist grind where we can be in this space of like presence and community. And I think that like it feels really radical. It might not have the direct impact of like on policy or anything like that, but to create the ability to be radically present with each other and to be like outside of the conditions that we're all laboring in the rest of the time. That's something that I'm really interested in doing like with events and with the spaces that I want to inhabit is to create space like that because I feel so much more sane afterward and I think a lot of people are craving that. But that's the radical subversion that I don't know that you were referring to in that one, that it's not the radical subversion of sex is dirty, it's the radical subversion of we are in this moment right now. And there's a there's I mean, it's what it's the equivalent in the civil rights movement of the cops are coming into the church to arrest Martin Luther King. It's like, what do we do? We're gonna sing. And they sing in this way. The cops are paralyzed. The people are just singing. They have no weapons. They know nothing, but they're singing. And it's just try to bust this sex party. They're gonna be just amazed by what's happening. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, the problem is sex parties don't look quite like how they feel. I don't think so. No, I don't think so. That was my experience when I was at one. I was like, I don't want to have sex ever again. You know, even the eyes wide shut thing, you look at that party, like, ugh. Yeah. It doesn't look like, that's not my idea of fun. But what is my idea of fun, and you remind me so much of her, and I know now you work with her. I interviewed on, I used to have a radio show on WFMU called The Media Squad. And one of my first guests was Molly Crabapple. My queen. But now you're doing stuff with the fact that you found Molly is just, I mean, Molly and I have been friends for a long time. Yeah, she and I met literally doing graffiti together. Oh, wow. Yeah, so we were just getting in trouble around the pandemic when the streets were empty. But we met through our mutual friend, Caroline, who was also doing graffiti. The two of them got arrested together. I didn't. Molly is a big inspiration. Like, she has successfully done something that I think is incredibly valuable in merging her interests in these different worlds. Like, as she was, we were talking about this the other day. Like, people who are insulated in one world, like the art world, sometimes don't realize their parties aren't good. And they need some people in the other worlds, like the nightlife scene, to bring that energy. And then sometimes you're at a party that's like all nightlife people, and you're like, I can't talk to anyone here. And it's not, like, I literally love the nightlife community, but I think the cross-pollination is really essential. And when you can do something that brings people outside of their comfort zones, the people who are here for the art are being brought into contact with a different cultural experience that's outside of their comfort zone. And the people who are in this nightlife world, which is so different, are experiencing a different kind of art. Like, I had this from both sides at my last reading where people who worked in the nightlife scene were like, I really am not a readings person. I hate like literary readings typically, but I really liked this, you know? And that's great to me. If you can find something that plays for both sides and that like demystifies because so many literary events I'm at, I'm like, wow, you have to really care about being someone in the literary scene to get anything out of this. Like, it sucks to be at an event and be like, everyone else has drunk the Kool-Aid, but I think this is about. They know something, or they read Derrida and now can relate to it, and I can't. I started this open mic night called Mike Check, where people are doing rant as performance. So you bring a PowerPoint and you rant about something. That's so fun. I've been wanting to do like a segment on Pleasure seeking that's like your Roman Empire. Like people rant about something that just is like lodged in their brain, you know? You're invited to do nights. Oh, maybe I will. Maybe I'll come rant. It'd be great. But that's the thing to then combine with this sort of the decadent dance people night scene, this sort of more, they need the nerds to be able to do that. That's what I'm trying to do with my literary readings as well. Is it's like, I think a lot of, regrettably, a lot of writers don't know how to party. And they could. They know how to drink or they know how to drink. Right, right, right. But it's like, I think the right ratio of a party should have some people who are pretty different from each other. You know, like, there really should be people from different walks of life where it becomes this hobnobby insider event that like you have to know X, Y, and Z person to even have a reason to want to be there if it's like a clout chasing event and cure the smaller. Nobody's there for the event's own sake. Exactly. So they're not just having fun to be like present. They're there to network and then it becomes very spoiled and just like bad vibe. And like that's what I'm trying to do with the salons that I'm throwing at the Chelsea is like with Molly. Well, Molly actually read in my last one. So, but we want to do a reading together, so stay tuned. But this one has been in the Chelsea hotel. What space in. Uh my friend Tony who's actually who connected me with Mike um is an amazing photographer. He I don't know if we're allowed to talk about this, probably we are, but um his name is Tony Noterbergino, amazing last name, and he's been documenting the hotel since like the nineties uh sort of as a photographer and he has this amazing space I've been going to for a long time. He is sort of the nexus of a certain nightlife community in New York where a lot of performers in the burlesque scene, like who you know are on stage at House of Yes or at the box, go to Tony's afterward to kind of perform for each other and put on these private shows that's like for the community. But it's this amazing like super safe sort of bohemian enclave in a historic apartment. It used to be Dee De Ramones. It's an amazing spot. You should come see it. It's not far from here. And it's just my favorite place in the world. I've been going to his parties for like six years. He's like single-handedly keeping New York alive. And we were talking about it and we were like, you know what? He always throws my birthday parties there. So I've done my birthdays there the last couple years and people always come away with like so many stories because we'll do burlesque shows. Like my friends would perform and it would make a strong impression. Some people fainted. It would make a strong impression. And I go to so many literary readings where I'm just like, they should invent a literary reading that is good. You know, like so many of these are like, I want to love it because I love literature. But when I hear it or when I'm in this environment, my brain's just like static. I'm like, I can't enjoy this. So now I've been doing a variety show where it's like half burlesque, half readings. So we'll alternate between like burlesque and drag acts and readings. Like the last one was around the theme of desire and Molly was one of the readers. And it keeps everyone pretty alive, keeps them guessing and brings a totally different energy to the space, and people leave feeling like they had an experience and they saw like something that they never would have expected instead of just like hearing something read out loud that they could have read on paper. It really makes it like this, especially the historic space and just the vibe that Tony cultivates there. Like, we partnered on the last event and used the proceeds to pay our performer friends and like to kind of give back to that community. But it is available to pleasure-seeking subscribers. That's the you have to be a pleasure-seeking subscriber to get in. Great. But for me, that's been really enriching to be able to live in that kind of interdisciplinary space that makes use for me of my actual interest in both of these worlds. Like, it's enriched my writing so much to be part of these scenes. I've interviewed these performers and stuff, and they're all amazing creatives, and they get to do a different type of performance, a different type of craft, and push themselves and do this, like, really body-focused work that's so different from the work of writing and editing. I have found being in person, being in these spaces, talking with them, and being part of their world, you know, to be so enriching. I want to share that. And so, for me, it's like a real labor of love to do these events at the Chelsea because, like, it is a space that doesn't exist a lot in New York anymore. It's not like there is a thriving subculture in the Chelsea Hotel outside of what Tony has, you know, like allowed to continue. He's really the person who's like holding that torch now. And yeah, I'm super grateful to get to do it and to bring creatives together in that space. But I'm totally on the same wave as you were, and as Molly, of like the more different types of performance and art that we have going on, the better. Like, these things should be cross-pollinating. We should not be siloed. Like, it's so inspiring, I think, for everyone. Well, thank you for holding the torch. Wow. I have to say, Tony's really holding it, but he gets to pass it to me when I'm in the middle of the day. But you're taking the torch. You took the, where you're running with Molly right now, and it's inspiring. It's inspiring. This is all is not lost, you know? As long as we can touch, taste, feel, you know. Yeah, there's a Euros is not, I mean, it's pleasurable, but it's also essential. Yeah. And it's power, and it's political, and it may be beyond the Lysistrata myth. You know, there's a way for those of us who choose to channel and fan the flames of Eros. There may just be more going on there. Yeah, I hope so. It's accessible to us all.

Thanks for being on Team Human. Our last best hope for peeps. These are Kobe Dryer Sheets. I never used a dryer sheet before in my life, so I have no basis of comparison. I once opened a box of bounce and got so sickened by the chemical odor, triggered even, that I just left them in the laundromat. And that's before I knew how those things ended up contaminating our landfill, rivers, and placentas with microplastic fibers and other forever shit. Then I met this guy, Tom, who was shooting a video in the studio downstairs, and it was for these dryer sheets that are part of a new movement to make 100% biodegradable cotton products that are good for people. He was interested in sponsoring Team Human, so I tried these things and they're actually good. Not just the essential oils that sent these things, but the sheets themselves. They smell good, they feel good. You won't find their residue polluting the placentas of women around the world, just biodegrading and growing into new life.
