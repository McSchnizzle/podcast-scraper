Tony Spezza here with AAA Heating Cooling. In the last five years, most of our competitors have become total sellouts, man. Literally, private equity has swept through Portland, gobbling up most of the locally owned heating and cooling companies, leaving corporate wreckage in their wake. At AAA Heating and Cooling, we're still family-owned and not going anywhere. We have Portland roots, not corporate suits. What do you say? AAA! AAAAA Heating and Cooling. CCP number 222. Hello, everyone. This is Philosophy for the People with Stefan Bertram. And today we are discussing Warhammer 40,000, especially in the context of fascism and villainy. How the best way to kind of make us admire or support some kind of organization or entity or state or whatever that's clearly bad is to set it against an enemy which is far worse. And how this kind of analogizes to the situation we're in in terms of campism, where people feel the need to take a side, not just take a side, but to actively support, to defend a certain size as good in global conflicts, even when plausibly they very much are not. Before the show even started, Skellum wrote, I always thought of Warhammer as a case study of why materialism is the way. The emperor tried again and again to engineer the perfect human instead of reforming the system and time and time he failed. Well, he did reform the system. He kind of built the empire, but whether that was a good move or a bad move. And it's interesting, I mean, what you're saying is obviously true in one sense that the making of the Primarchs was a complete disaster. But subsequently, it has been the superhumans that the Emperor made that have been the defenders, the useful ones as the whole thing falls apart. If all of the words I'm saying now are gibberish, don't worry because the first few slides are focused on explaining Warhammer 40,000 without making any assumption that anyone here knows what Warhammer 40,000 is. Stu says, I don't know if I take it that seriously. I mean, I don't take Warhammer particularly seriously. I mean, I like it a lot. I've read three Warhammer books this week, so I'm a big serious aficionado. I just think it's interesting. I think there's a difference between taking something seriously in a like, I don't think Warhammer 40,000 is particularly relevant. I think often how people will understand the only way they can understand an analysis of media in any political way is to say that like Dark Souls makes people fascist is something that people have said on Twitter this week. That's not the sort of analysis I want to give where media causes things to happen, but rather how things, how media can reflect the world rather than causing the world. Stu says, I know you have a lot of miniatures in your closet. I sadly do not. I haven't had a lot of miniatures in a long time. Though you can see here these piles of things are magically gathering cards. So same difference. Campism as fashion, as fandom. Oh, wait, we're on slide 14 because I was checking it earlier. Spoilers, everyone. Warhammer 40,000, fascism, and pessimism. We all love. A villain. Summary. We support and admire things relationally in the context of what they're set against. In other sci-fi universes, the Imperium would be the villains, but they are set against such horrendous forces in Warhammer 40,000 that this decrepit fascist empire is very much in the right. I'll reflect on this later, but one of the grim things in the Grimdark segment of Warhammer 40,000 is not just the empire is evil, but the empire is also highly ineffectual. This provides an interesting window in how we think about heroes and villains. We live very much in a purely campused age, as in the sense that there's no actual real communist global bloc or anything like this. And so socialists are always making choices between different capitalist entities or states or whatever else. We live in a very, very campused age where we're continually asked to choose between two sides, which are bad. Grimdark fiction has an interesting place here in reflecting this and also reflects the pessimistic spirit of our times, perhaps even more so than what Warhammer was first introduced. Because, you know, Warhammer did come into place, was first kind of engineered under Thatcher with K-Mus. And, you know, a lot of the references and the pessimism has to do with Thatcherite Britain. But actually, Warhammer didn't really become popular until the 1990s and the 2000s when we were in the Blairite age and things were much more optimistic. And so it seems almost like Warhammer makes more sense now than it did back then. And the other way I think this is relevant, as I was also slightly discussing in the pre-introduction, I suppose, people will act as regarding, say, North Korea or Hamas or on the other side, the IDF or whatever, they'll act with these groups as fans in the same way that they would treat a fictional organization. There isn't really a distinction about them. Is the Empire that effectual? Maybe you misheard me, and maybe I wasn't pronouncing it clear enough. I said ineffectual. The problem with the Empire is that it doesn't really work while also being really evil. That's basically kind of the center part of the grim darkness. Foy K is fascinating for portraying a world where this grim fascist state that is rotting out from the inside is still fundamentally in the right. Maybe some people disagree with that. This is true on several different fronts. But the main way they're right is because they're faced with a fundamentally evil opponent, chaos. Merely calling chaos evil to someone who isn't familiar with the setting, I think, kind of almost fails to get across how horrible, how terrible, how bad chaos is. This includes almost everyone that follows chaos ends up in a lose-lose situation, up to including like the demon Primarchs. Even among the very highest followers of chaos, imaginingly far from any human cultist, they are often miserable, such as Motarian, or given so over to their desires and emotions, like Angron, that they're basically non-sapient and are completely unfree. They're less free than just a random human who lives a horrible, terrible life, but still has more freedom than Angron, this superhuman wizard. Basically, we're going to get into a bit more of the law in a second, whose mind has just been taken over by this war god to such a degree that all he knows is rage and pain and fighting and so on. Stu's pointing out that of one of the four gods, Nurgle, his demons are often quite happy, and some of his followers are happy. But Motarian, the head Nurgleite boy, is a miserable, miserable bastard. He like keeps his father or his father's spirit, not his actual father, but his like adoptive father's spirit in a jar. And when he's like mad about him, he will like torture his spirit. And he's been doing this for 10,000 years. Really cheery guy, is Motarian. What is chaos? Important to know that in the world of Wohemafoyike, thought doesn't make the world fully, but thought is very influential in the world. Is basically like a break in the universe of Warhammer 40,000. It's like, what if our universe, but all of our bad thoughts, lived in a realm, and unfortunately, our galaxy is filled with holes, and the bad thoughts are getting out, and they want to kill you. Um, chaos is this reflection of the feelings of sapient beings, especially the negative ones. I don't think I'm not deep into the law on this point, but I think we're more negative than positive here just because the galaxy is a shit miserable place. One could dress up before chaos gods in pleasant garb. You could portray Korn as the god of honor and righteous war, Slanesh as the god of love and creative desire, Zinch as the god of knowledge and hope, and Nurgle as the god of fortitude and growth. But in the grim darkness of the 40th millennia, Korn is the god of bloodlust, Slanesh is the god of unrelating and unconsuming desire. Tzinch is the god of amandoning knowledge and change for its own sake, and in some ways is thus kind of the perfect chaos god, like the actual chaos god. And Nurgle is the god of despair and plague. But their broad domain, the fact that they do cover all these things, means that even bright desires feed them. All killing feeds corn. Pleasure in simple things feeds Slanesh. Desire for rightful change feeds Zinch. And something as fundamental to the Imperium, this fascist empire, as accepting your place in the world feeds Nurgle. Bootstrap Han Jacob suggests: Happen Nurgle only wants to bring you presents. We can discuss this at the end, but people will just talk about which one is the least worst chaos god, and people will say Nurgle. But to me, Nurgle is clearly the worst one. And the least worst one is Korn. What is the Imperium? In the broadest possible terms, it was an abortive effort to destroy these chaos gods and is now their main fuel. Fundamental to the Imperium is its God Emperor, an incredibly powerful wizard who took control of humanity in the year approximately 30,000. He attempted to starve chaos of its fuel by instituting a rational, rationalist, atheistic, galactic empire and also conquered the galaxy in the process. Well, a lot of it. But by hiding chaos from his people, they easily fell to it. And in his crushing of this rebellion, 10 of his sons or nine of his sons rose up against him. It all went very badly. And in the end, he was mortally wounded. He was interned on the golden throne on the edge of death, this big mechanism which keeps him alive, where through immense sacrifice, I mean literal sacrifice, they like actually. I don't actually don't want to get too deep into law nerdy bullshit. But basically, they sacrifice a thousand wizards a day to him. And only through this sacrifice and his own constant, immense sacrifice, like he's in agony, sat there on the throne and has been for 10,000 years, almost mindless in this constant struggle against chaos, are they kept back from conceiving earth. But after this half-death, only his most loyal superhuman soldiers, the space marines, kept his atheistic creed, while the rest of the empire turned to worship him as the god emperor, which, because of the structure of the world of 40,000, of 140k, this made him into the god emperor. It's not the only aspect of the emperor of mankind, but he has become in the warp in this fucked up realm of emotions. He's become this entity which has the power to intervene, has the power to do things, just because people believe that he does. I think the law is that the chaos gods were once the gods of those nice aspects, but mortals made them what they are by a torrent of negative emotions. I don't think it's that straightforward, but that is a reasonable account of what's happened. And maybe the account is based on the fact that, like, negative emotions are stronger than positive emotions. I don't want to kind of do this kind of thing. I think it would actually probably be quite interesting to do a discussion. Of this kind of pessimistic approach to emotions, maybe to do with antinatalists and so on, where there is a suggestion that negative feelings are stronger than positive feelings, like in a general sense. Soon asked, why is it called 40k again? It's called 40k because it's happening in the year 40,000, 40,000 AD, as in 38,000 years in the future from now. Though a large part of the saying actually is set in the year 30,000. Since then, his empire, which is once brutal and efficient, became brutal and inefficient. The emperor's empire was also brutal and horrible and was fundamentally genocidal against alien species, some of which deserved it, most of which didn't. But since then, it has kept all the negative parts that he put into it and then gained a lot more negative parts from kind of religious dogmatism to just not working very well. Everything is in continual and slow-motion collapse, occasionally revived by some immense individual, like is what's currently happening with Guilleman. Spelled his name wrong. Guillermin is one of the sons of the Emperor and the only one that's around at the moment. The brutality and horror of the empire is what's spinning it into further collapse, as humans do not only fuel the god Emperor, but are also fuel for all the chaos gods. While nearly every follower of chaos is not served by joy and chaos, the beating down masses do not know this, they're kept in deliberate ignorance. All social revolutionary sentiment will be exploited by chaos cultists, and all dissent to the Imperium is painted as chaos worship. But even if humans do not rebel, their misery feeds chaos. And the strength of chaos intensifies their misery, and so on and so forth. The imperium is locked in some very obvious and very unpleasant native feedback loops. Alias says the lion is back too. That's true. He's not a real lion, he's a man. That was also a very good book that I read: the return of the lion. So two of the emperor's sons are back, but only one of them is really on the big political scene. The lion is kind of just walking back and forth through various forests. Who were the heroes of 140k? Normally, the more enlightened members of this brutal fascist hierarchy. Two heroes that I've recently read about. One of the last ones was just a really, really angry woman. She was one of the Sisters of Silence, which I won't explain what they are, but this is a militant religious organization. And a woman smiled at her and she like blasted her with her mind. More obvious kind of terrible stuff was: I read a couple of books about the Inquisition who engaged in the sort of activities you'd expect from an organization called the Inquisition. And in this first book of this, they're fighting against this evil, they think, cult in the underhives and then the grained massive living quarters of earth. And what they find out, they assume these people are doing these horrible tortures to these people, but actually, it turns out it's these evil aliens who are torturing these people. And actually, this cult is like a self-organized, autonomous public reaction to these slaughter and this torture. And it's led by this man who was a former Imperial Guard captain. And so, in the end, they join forces with him and they fight and they win. And you know, all these cultists die bravely in the fighting. Their leader survives. And you know what his reward is? The hero of our tale interrogates him and then shoots him in the head. And this is a guy which is a very reasonable Inquisitor as they go. But that's all you get in Warhammer 40k. And the thing is, with the setting being how it is, there's much heroism to be had. Because in the end, these people are resisting chaos, or they're resisting the tyrannids, or resisting the dark elder, or whatever else. The tyrannids are evil space bugs who want to eat everything. I mean, everything. They're going to eat everything in the galaxy. The Dark Eldor are elves who are only immortal as long as they continually torture people. In this context, space fascism really doesn't seem that bad. Unfortunately, the Imperium is a lot worse than fascist Italy in space. Far, far worse. Servitors are a particularly grim part of the Imperium. Being normal people who commit a minor crime, because any sort of major crime in Imperium is punished with death, at least for normal people. Aristocrats will obviously get away with all sorts. For minor crimes, you can become a servitor, which is where they scoop out half your brain and replace it with some very basic mechanical parts. And then you become like, because the Empire doesn't allow AI. And so you become some kind of like, you become the targeting computer for a gun for the rest until your body rots away and is destroyed. Stu says gene stealers also capitalize on rebellion. Gene stealers are the kind of precursors of the Tyrannid attack. They come to human worlds, they interbreed with humans, they make lots of fucked up hybrids, and they get the humans to welcome the Tyranids on the basis that it's going to be some grand, happy, utopic event. And then they all get turned into biomass and destroyed. Skeleton says, I've always interpreted the 40k hyacracy as an implicit critique of the emperor's design. Yeah, I think that's definitely true. I mean, it might not even be implicit. He didn't trust people, he didn't engineer to be perfect, only he realized there's no such thing as perfect people. The thing is, Skelem, he didn't also trust the perfect people because he didn't tell his sons about chaos, and that's why most of them fell to chaos. Christopher asks, Am I too old to understand what the hell Grimdark is? I don't think so. I also think Grimdonk has been probably around, unless you're very old, I don't know. I think Grimdark's probably been around, if not popular, since you were young. The Sean says the Emperor is absolutely the villain. I definitely don't think so. The Emperor is a really, really horrible guy who did all sorts of terrible things, but there are four worse guys than him out there in the world. Why are things like this? As in a meta-sense, why is the setting written to be like this? Warhammer is not an attempt to defend fascist reactionary politics. Rather, it's a setting for a war game. Why, in the grim darkness of the future, is there any war? Because it's a war game. Of course, being a war game doesn't require such. You can either focus in on particular circumstances, as in you just set your warbrain around World War II, or you make a world of more noble combat, which is Games Workshop's other setting, Age of Sigmar. But 40K was chosen to be Grimdark from the start and is stuck with that. The evilness of the Imperium is something which is toyed with and pushed and pulled with. Gibbs Workshop needs to portray the Imperium as heroes, but to keep the setting Grimdark, they also need to portray them as really fucking evil. They need to portray them as heroes because they're the main faction, they're the main group. They, you know, they need to be the miniature boys. You know, they need to have they need to sell the miniatures, they need to sell the books about the miniatures and whatever. And so that requires putting the Empire, the Imperium, at the center of things. So that requires telling from their PO view. And you can have a villain POV, but when it's a majority POV, I don't mind pronouncing POB so weirdly there. Stu says, I like 40k, but I enjoy the fantasy side the most. Yeah, I also probably like the fantasy stuff more, but because it was less popular, the setting isn't as deep, and so you can't kind of drag out all these interesting things about it. Why grimdark? Why do we enjoy villains? Often because they're more active than heroes, they do more, are less restrained, they go after what they want. Grimdark fantasy or sci-fi lets the villains be heroes. You make the situation so tough. Terrible that people that would normally be the villains become the heroes because they're set against such a terrible organization. And this lets you use the villain who's active, who's willing to do whatever they need to do, and puts them in a heroic role. And it's easy to see what the appeal is. As I discussed in the violence episode, there's a great desire in us to see bad things happen to bad people and for this to be righteously inflicted upon them by those willing to engage in this sort of violence. Grimdot allows this in spades, while the protagon that does it coming, that does it without the protagon that does it coming off is insane or extreme. You can have a vengeance-filled protagonist who does terrible things to terrible people, and they can seem normal because there's worse people in the setting. They're just doing a correct imperial procedure. Podbean, your message amplified. Ready to share your message with the world? Start your podcast journey with Podbean.

At Golden Valley Brewery, we know good times come from time spent with friends along with great food. And that great food starts with fresh picked produce from our gardens, locally raised burgers and steaks, and our own hand-crafted beers. Come see why we're different. Golden Valley Brewery, farmed above since 1993. Christopher asks, is this related to Dungeons and Dragons? Only distantly. Deshaun says Warhammer Fantasy got got or got shafted. It did in fact get shafted, sadly. The thing is now they're bringing it back. like a bit the old world stuff and it was such a it's so weird they got they got rid of the board game just as they were making warhammer fantasy uh total war warhammer fantasy then they got rid of the the tabletop game it was so weird hell yeah stu says painting of stormcast right now people are listening to this podcast and they're paying 40k miniatures oh sorry edge of sigma miniatures but portraying the avatars of this fascist reactionary empire has led to a section of the fandom being reactionary it appeals to certain reactionary peoples some of this is just sub-intellectual rah-rah it's people being like wow there's humans and they kill aliens and they're religious isn't that sick but there are also political strategies where people will employ 40k to try and get some sort of point across in the imperium in the universe the imperium is portrayed as both necessary reasonable sorry these people will portray the imperium as both necessary, which is a reasonable account, and as good as it possibly could be, which is obviously not true. And they make an outer universe analogy between this and our present circumstances: that we need something like the Imperium in order to cope with the world. And that wokes are the forces of chaos who believe in degradation for their own sake. And they liken transgender stuff to demonic corruption and demonic modification and so on. This extends to our East Slavic nerds fighting in the Ukraine war with who are not content just to be like, oh, we're elves and they're orcs, but also engage in 40k LARP. This is inverted compared to the 40k situation where the Russians portray themselves as the orcs and the Ukrainians as the elves, where instead here the Russians embrace the Imperium. They'll use the little purity markers that the Imperium uses, while the Ukrainians prefer chaos, with one of their major drone units being called the Korn Unit. Deshaun says, Motorium isn't a villain considering Papal Nurgle doesn't view his blight as negative. I don't get that argument. But this is the sort of thing we can argue about at the end, if you were. Interested. Once I get to the end, I'll just go full nerd and we can just chat about lore and bullshit. Uh, Scalum says Grimdark feels more realistic in a way. If you want a story about fighting, it feels right to have heroes and not be nice guys and touch by sorting bad guys all day long. Yeah, I think that's an interesting point. Um, Grimdark can also seem realistic and seems to like fill in a gap that other fiction lacks. Like, this isn't really true, but there is a certain stereotype about other sorts of heroic fiction where you'll be like, Oh, I can't kill the villain, I'd become just like him, despite the fact that you've killed like a hundred mooks on the way there.

It doesn't help, and Luke says that it doesn't help that Slanesh ate all the elves because they were hedonists. But there's also a woke fandom 40k. But, I mean, in the sense that there are woke people who enjoy Warhammer 40,000 because it's a popular game. But the woke people that enjoy Warhammer 40k don't necessarily have a lot of material to go off as an actual in-union sort of stuff. There are the Tao, but they're kind of boring. The Tao are like the Imperium, like scaled down and made much nicer. Uh, they don't, and maybe like the early Imperium, they don't really understand the warp and chaos and stuff. Uh, they're they're a small empire, but they're a lot less grimdark. They would still, they still do like re-education camps and are like harsh and in counter-insurgency. They probably aren't any more grimdark than like contemporary nation states that actually exist in our world. Instead, what it's engaged in is a lot of creative and reinterpretation. But sadly, a lot of this is not particularly interesting, creative interpretation. There's a lot of just dull inversionism, which is very common these days. Um, a lot of it is to do with reinterpreting chaos, especially Slanesh, and being like, Yeah, actually, trans people are just like demons, and that's cool. The biggest circular drama in the fandom is over female space marines. But the idea, when taken unseriously, is popular among the broad fandom. Um, space marines are all male, they're the big heroes in the setting, and they're all male. Um, they're also like all sterile males, and you imagine who are like massively jacked up on like super hormones and how our gene organ edited. So, we'll be like, oh, what would a female Space Marine look like? And I think, as Jean has said, um, you'll hear on the podcast or elsewhere, maybe to me, a female space marine would just look like a male space marine because they're so jacked up on hormones and so on. World Warcraft fandom also normally stands on the side of well, actually, the Imperium is bad, but there's little radical here because, of course, they are. Is Horace a genuine revolutionary or reactionary socket? Puppet? I guess it depends how you see the Chaos Gods, but he in the end was totally cooked to them. They had complete and total control over Horace, who's the leader of the rebellion against the Emperor. Warhammer also always did satire about the government initially, at least. Yeah, I mean, it was like a piss take of the British state, such as existed in the 80s and 90s. The most obvious example, which foreigners might not know, is that orcs are entirely based on British football hooligans. Fan interpretations of Warhammer 40,000 also matter more than it would to do with other works, or more interestingly to talk about at least, because Warhammer 40k is a shared universe. There's no author of 40K. There wasn't even like one guy who originally came up with the spine of the idea. Rather, it's always been a series of authors. There's never been an author, there never will be an author, and there was no An author in the past. Instead, many hundreds of authors continually contribute to a labyrinthine edifice, which is a bit like the Imperium. And all these guys were presumably, or almost all of them, used to be fans. So there's a direct continuity between the people who read about Waba 40k online and make up fan theories and stuff to the people who actually then go about and make the future of it. This does seem like a mode of the future where books become more like shared universes and everything has to have a shared universe. Now, Call of Duty and Five Nights at Freddy's must have this deep lore. I was absolutely had my mind blown when I like typed something into Google. I think it was a Magic the Gathering card name, but the result that came up was some lore page, and I clicked on the law page. And it was, I was reading all this weird lore about this extra-dimensional, evil Paul land. And then I learned that it was lore from a Call of Duty game, which back in my day was about shooting Arab terrorists. I'm going to catch up on the comments probably when I get to the end because I've only got two more slides to go. Media as a total life solution. The other way this matters is that people increasingly expect their media franchise to do everything for them. We expect everything to represent us and have good politics and so on. 40k is so sharply terrible that I think it's generally pervaded the demand for good politics. Though it has, to its benefit, become much more gender-neutral as time goes on. The last three Warhammer books, despite the fact that Space Marines and various other transhumans in the setting can only be male, the last three Warhammer books I've read have portrayed the setting as completely gender neutral otherwise. But the setting is still constrained to nerd spaces. If it ever went mainstream like Game of Thrones, this would change. People who are fans of the TV show genuinely think that J.R. Martin likes, I don't know if I should say that word on a podcast. He's a fan of sexual assault and incest, not in the sense that he finds them interesting literary tropes, no, as in he thinks they're like mint. And though, you know, and obviously he did, I think he added an incest support line to the Dark Souls, not Dark Souls, the new one, Elden Ring. And obviously that's because J.R. Martin finds the concept very interesting, but it doesn't mean he approves of it. But I think we're increasingly unable to distinguish these things. This would be the fate of any mainstream 40k, but it's hard to see it happen. If there's a big 40k show, it's going to be balanced on a very fine knife point to please hardcore fans and normies. Soon is giggling about me saying mint, which I guess is not American English, but I assume you can work out what it means. It means good. It means very good. We finally get to campism as fandom. At the same time, people treat real politics as if they were famous. People basically argue identically over the Imperium as they do North Korea or Hamas. This is especially relevant because people very often feel the need to support groups which are very clearly bad because they're against something worse. This isn't necessarily wrong, but it's quickly twisted. Again, I can't actually say words like support Hamas I or something like this in reference to in the context of them opposing another organization because for legal reasons. But people will take ideas like that and transform them into actively thinking that Hamas is like a great organization who are lovely and they never did anything wrong and you know October 7th wasn't that bad. Most of the stuff didn't happen and blah blah blah. All efforts to be critically in critical solidarity are very quickly twisted to just believing the people you're defending are good. The alternative is rhetorically complicated and often unconvincing to listeners. So we just cheer. Matt Gilbert says politics is just another dimension of personality. I mean we would like it not to be, but I think very concretely that you are very much correct, Matt. That's the last slide. I'm going to go back to slide one. And I'm going to read back in the comments. Summary for people I'll get rid of that in a few minutes. But if anyone arriving late, you can read the summary. I'm going to go back to the comments. And then, if anyone wants to argue about Warhammer Law or discuss Warhammer Law or, you know, the actual subject of today's thing, you can also talk about that. We'll do that up until about the hour mark. Tony Spenzy here with Triple A Heating and Cooling.

We'll replace it with something that actually works before the candles melt on their own. Call AAA Heating and Cooling today. We fix the heat without the meltdown. What do you say? AAA! AAAAAA Heating and Cooling. CCB number 222. Ah, I was up to Vlad talking about Horace. Is Horace a genuine revolutionary or a reactionary soccer puppet? So I think the thing with Horrors from the beginning, as opposed to someone like Logar, is that Horace was never, you never had a different vision for the Imperium. He was just kind of, it was like a personal drama. He was a resentful son who was captured by certain corrupted influences around him and then totally submersed by chaos in the end. So I don't think there's ever any possible argument that Horace was at all revolutionary. Skellum says that space marines of either gender have only a 10 years connection to humanity, anyways, which is again correct. There's an interesting concept in Warhammer in the universe of transhuman dread that people will basically just fear, like this deep-set fear when they're faced with a space marine or a custodes or whatever. And that's something to do with like warp stuff and magic and blah blah blah. But I think there's a very concrete thing of that: that if you saw not just like a man who was seven foot and incredibly muscular, but also a man that was seven foot tall, incredibly muscular, and just moved in an inhumanly fast way, I think you would have this kind of uncanny valley reaction to it, where you would be almost genuinely completely horrified. Like, what is this thing? Stefan, have you read any utopian fiction? I've read the culture. I read the culture when I was in Syria. And I enjoyed the culture books a lot, though I can't really remember much of it because I was very tired a lot of the time in Syria when I was reading these books. So I think a lot of it didn't really go into my head. I couldn't really remember the player of games, even though I read like many culture books when I was there. But yes. Yeah, so obviously the utopian stuff is often a counterpart to Grimdark, but I think it also shows why Grimdark is appealing. Because the problem with the culture novels is maybe there's one of them, but nearly every culture novel, as is Ian Banks, the culture is a basically communist culture in the future who were past any kind of scarcity. They live in a peaceful society, though they keep guns because not every society is communist. And lots of stuff is now run by AI minds. But the problem with that for fictional universes is how do you then make an interesting story? And the answer for Ian M. Banks in nearly every tale is to set it outside the culture on either the complete fringe of the culture. He never actually really portrays stuff inside the culture because there's not much going on. History is ended in the culture. Violence is ended in the culture. So there's not really much to be said, much to be done. Luke says, I'm ruminating on how 40k was aimed at a critique of Thatcherite UK, but the things that stick out to the reactions are the Stoic Marines and the sex demons. Yeah, I think the thing is much of 40k, so a lot of the stuff early on was kind of like a parody of Thatcherism, but then Warhammer Law wasn't really solidified until like the probably mid-90s. The first space marine novels I think came out. The mid-90s, because the thing is, back in the day, to go back to the Five Nights at Freddies example, not everything was expected to have a current universe. You just had a war game, and it was like had cool miniatures, and some of them were evil, and some of them were good, and whatever. You necessarily have to have this deep law, and I think it's because more because of the Warhammer RPGs, like Rogue Trader, where you actually kind of had to fill in the blanks and portray a setting so that GMs could use it. Do you think James Workshop and its marketing is at fault for the proliferation of real-life Imperium fanboys, or is that something outside of their control? Um, I guess in some sense, but they do portray it's interesting because it on one hand, they do portray the Imperium, or at least the people in the books of the in the Imperium, as very good people, very high-minded, virtuous people, even when they're set against various other people in the Imperium who aren't. I've been reading various 40k novels for a while, and all the novel, all the people that are on the side of the Imperium are high-minded, virtuous, cool guys, basically. But the Imperium at the same time is portrayed as a really horrible, horrible place. But then, of course, I should also say I shouldn't be like the leader of Iran who was like, Well, of course, all Americans have read Tochi Vel. Most 4K fans have not read the books, and probably most are understanding and they don't play the game either. They haven't read the books, they haven't played the game, um, but their understanding of the setting comes from law videos. But I think also the law videos, even in that case, like the Imperium is portrayed so horribly that a lot of the lore videos I see about Warhammer 40k people can say if they what the main kind of video of 40k stuff they see is like what are the 10 worst jobs in the imperium what are the 10 worst space marine chapters and stuff like this um so i think games workshop really does portray that the setting is a horrible horrible place i don't think they can really be blamed for people being fans of them because you do really need to portray your protagonists i mean that's actually an interesting question because the imperium is a grimdark place but i would say actually a lot of the books aren't actually grimdark compared to other people um i forget his name uh but one of the main british grimdark authors it's not just that the setting is grimdark but the protagonists are grimdark they're they're all not heroic they all fail to be heroic and this is quite novel i mean it's not like in jrm in uh song of lesson five some of the protagonists are heroic and some of them decidedly are not like tyrann um and people love tyrion despite the fact that he's clearly not heroic um in a conventional sense but in warhamma 40k at least in the novels i've read the setting is grimdark but the imperium protagonists are high-minded virtuous noble people who do terrible things but at the same time are not lacking and failing in the same way that most Grimdark protagonists are. Vlad says dune god emperor is better than 40k Emperor and soon says the creators of 40k seem to be inspired by God Emperor June. That is definitely true on both counts. Um, Damien Walter called the culture hippies with guns or the Tao communist? No, though I haven't read a single Tao novel, um, but they're definitely not communist in the substantive sense that say the culture are communist because they are uh ripped by one, highly hierarchical. They have they go back and forth about this, but they're divided into castes, but there's also a ruling caste which uses like mind control, mind manipulation to rule over the rest. So they're definitely not communist in the sense of you know, real post-scarcity communism. But I also don't think they are at all like socialist or on the road to socialism or anything like this. So I don't actually know. And maybe I'll read a Tao novel and get back to you. Anyone that can read has read a Tao novel? Does Prophet exist in the Tao universe in the Tao Empire, in the Tao, whatever they're called? I imagine. It does, but I think that would be the fundamental thing. Um, are things are they dominated by commodity production? Are things bought and sold in the Tau Empire mainly for the sake of making profit? Stu says it's crazy that there's still no space scaling, and he's correct. James Workshop needs to find more interesting poster boys in the Ultramarines. The funny thing is, I was because I actually have played, I've not ever really played 440k properly on tabletop, but I was playing a bit of my local game store. I was playing a bit of Kill Team, which is a small-scale version of 40k. I was playing a bit of that before it kind of died out of the shop. And I was thinking through the 20 Space Marine, well, the 18 mainstream mainline Space Marine chapters. I was thinking which one do I actually think is the coolest? And unfortunately, the answer is for me the boring ultramarine, because I think the ultramarines are like the most cultured and sophisticated of the like 18 main chapters. Um, I think maybe the uh before they fell, Ogram's lot were more cultured and so on. But of course, they fled to Saunesh, so maybe they cared about culture a bit too much. Skellum says Joan McCron, but yes, that's the person I met five minutes ago. Skellum says 140k tabletop takes forever to play. Yeah, I mean, we were playing Kill Team, which is just 12 versus 12 or 8 versus 12 things like this, and it still took a while, but it was mostly because we didn't have the rules. We had the rules, we weren't very good with the rules. Grey Knights and Blood Angels are good. Blood Angels are kind of, I find it just a bit edgy and weird. And Grey Knights are like, I mean, I know that they've, I think they've redone the Grey Knights Lore recently. But they did some ridiculous, horrible stuff. Like, I mean, maybe we should just like, because the thing is, with 140k with a lot of lore, you can just be like, no, that bit I've decided is not true. I don't believe in it. It's not real. And the notable bit with the Grey Knights, I'll get rid of this and you can see more of my faith. The horrible bit with the Grey Knights was they apparently slaughtered a whole chapter of Sisters of Battle and used their blood to coat themselves in order to make them more resistant against chaos, which is, of course, like a complete grim moment, but did really put me off the Grey Knights, even though maybe I shouldn't blame them for having this terrible bit of lore written about them. Yeah, I think they've gone a bit back and forth on the towel. My impression is that they made them quite nice at the start, then they pulled back a bit and they made them like, well, they pulled back a lot and made them really significantly grimdark. And now they've made them a bit better again now. I don't think the necrons are bad. People will say the necrons are really bad. The necrons seem all right to me. I mean, the main problem with the necrons is that most of them aren't sapient, but as a civilization, they don't seem that horrible to me. You know, in the murder quotient, they're quite high. But in the torture quotient, my impression is that the necrons are very low. Apart from the fact that a lot of them necrons, which are sapient but are lower down the chain, are stuck in these horrible circumstances where their brains aren't quite adapted to their, sorry, their minds, their souls, whatever, aren't quite adapted to the metal bodies. And so they constantly have this feeling of needing to breathe and things like this, but they can't because they're in these metal bodies. Yes, probably different. Well, not with Gondor normally, more normally with elves. The division is orcs versus elves as opposed to one group identifying with the humans. Because obviously it's a bit silly to identify with the humans. And I think the Numenorians are a bit too complex of a concept for most people to really grok. Though I love Numenorans. I love elves, but the one thing I love more than elves are Numenorians. But yes, they identify with the elves and chaos, which should be completely contradictory, but it's not. This sounds like something I would have absolutely loved at age 14. Yeah, the trick is to learn about it when you're 14 and then obsess about it the rest of your life. I mean, actually, I got into Warhammer when I was maybe like eight or something like this. Well, that mainly consisted of breaking my cousin's miniatures. Sorry, which bit soon? Just the bit about Numenorians or the bit about chaos. So the Ukrainians, the thing with the orcs and the elves, I don't know if I've ever actually talked about it in the podcast. Maybe I just have never talked about it because I like I've talked about it so many times in other places I never thought to talk about it in here. But with orcs and elves, Lord of the Rings was very, very popular in the former Soviet Union. And but in a kind of oppositionist way, there was this very big Russian fanfiction which was published like in paper called The Last Ring Bearer, where the Russians, this Russian author, reinterpreted Lord of the Rings in this inverted way, where instead of the elves being the hero, the orcs were the hero. They were this civilization. I've tried reading The Last Ring Bearer, but even the official translation, I can read it and I can just see how much worse it is than the Russian prose. So I've never really done it. But yes, this led to lots of Russians identifying with the orcs and viewing kind of inverting the normal story of Lord of the Rings, where they were like this industrial culture that were destroyed by the West and so on. And then when the conflict started to intensify between Ukraine and Russia, these cultures clashed, and Ukrainians were like, okay, the Russians are orcs, but we're elves because we're from the West. And then more recently, the situation with Ukraine has been these kind of leading groups in Ukraine, they're obviously often fascistic, the most useful kind of Ukrainian military units, often deeply fascistic. But this comes along with the culture of being like intensely warlike, intensely glorifying violence. And obviously, this is not something that you really see anywhere in Lord of the Rings. So instead, lots of kind of Ukrainian people have reached instead for Warhammer, which is very popular there also. And they've reached specifically for the Chaos Gods and for Korn, the God of War. And so the emblems of Chaos and the emblems of Korn are placed in a lot of Ukrainian military vehicles. One of the main drone units follows Korn. And so, probably the same people don't LARP as elves and LARP as chaos cultures at the same time, but rather there's just like strands of weird nerdery going on. Skullum says, Well, Hammer Law is so big that it often feels like a Roshos test. You can find any theme you want somewhere. Yeah, so like the very top Necrons now have like significant personalities, and the ones down below still don't really, I think. I'm not really clear if they're properly sapient or whatever. And so, yeah, that's the kind of decider for me. Like, the Tyrannids are really bad because they don't just kill sapients, but they aren't really sapient themselves. They only have like this hive intelligence. Well, the Necrons, if they had a civilization where they had loads and loads of sapient people, and the thing with the Necrons is they're very good at fucking up chaos. And so, if Necrons were actually mostly sapient, I'd be like, go Necrons, conquer the galaxy, kill everyone, it's fine, as long as at the end you defeat chaos and made the galaxy like a livable place. Well, yeah, I mean, obviously, the dark it was the elder who created Slanesh 10,000 years ago, but I think that there aren't any cults of Selesh among dark elder in Warhammer 40k. I think that's only in Warhammer Fantasy, because in Warhammer 40K, things are like very, very hard line, where if they go over to Selenesh at all, their soul just instantly kind of slips away. Yeah, I mean, Astral's saying, yeah, I mean, it's always a bit funny to identify as like the humans in some kind of situation like this. But yeah, obviously, it's different with identifying with Imperium because they identify with a specific kind of organization, the Imperium, who are fighting against chaos and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then, of course, like liberalism is associated with chaos and Western values and LGBT and whatever, they're all chaos and so on and so forth. We are coming up to an hour. Did anyone have anything else to say before I start loading the outro? All right there. Thank you, Luke, who said great stream. I'll put that on screen to clarify myself. I hope it was. I think the main trouble I had there was I did frame the slides so that people, everyone could understand it, including people who weren't Warhammer 40k nerds. But then, when I was engaging with the comments, it was much harder for me to do this because we were making reference to things that I hadn't explained. But I still also want to always engage with the comments. I mean, sometimes normally when I do this with Ben, it's hard to engage with the comments because Ben never stops talking. And when Ben's never stopped talking, I just need to get my chances to say something and try to bring us back on topic rather than trying to chat with the comments. So, when I'm alone, it's obviously I need the, I should take my chance to actually interact with people talking. But it can also, in a situation like this, be confusing, distracting, people who don't actually know about the setting. And there's the danger of like, obviously, I've chosen when I've done Lord of the Rings, I've done June, I've now done 40k. And June obviously is the video I did in June is like my favorite one ever. So much that I kind of just want to do it again because when I did it, I was still when I didn't do PowerPoints, I instead read off a script. And in some ways, that flows better, but also it was like you could clearly see being like the whole time, like just looking over here to where my notes were. Vlad is asking, who is the most Sigma male Primarch? I think it is Conrad Cruz, evil Batman, really evil Batman. It's kind of hard for any of the Primarchs to be Sigma. Oh, right. It's Alfarius. Right. Yeah, I mean, Stephanie Alfarius slash Omegaron, whatever the fuck he's called. It's always Alfarius. Congratulations is second, I guess. But it's hard for a Primark to be Sigma, right? Because they're leaders of massive armies. Stu says, bring back the TIR nerd show. I'll tell Jason that he's got one fan. I think the problem with any show, which who was the TI nerd show? Was that like Gene and someone? Who was doing that? Was that Gene? Was that like the White Boy show? I think Gene's kind of stopped doing a lot of stuff. To the degree this is probably going to be the TI nerd show. Oh, and if anyone wants to quickly get in what I should do next week as a suggestion, I don't know what I'm going to be doing next week. I'm trying to do one of these every week, though. It does take me quite a while because I have to write the full PowerPoint. So if anyone has any suggestions, please put them in the chat RN. I would say also or put them in a comment on the show, but I think a few people will watch to the end because I think after I've stopped. You know, this is fun for us to do right now. I think if people are watching on the VOD, they probably would have turned off at some point. You know, hopefully, they listen to the main thing. But this blabbery, but they might skip. What army would Jason play? Yeah, I mean, you're right. I mean, maybe we play Cornerland Cruisers, boys, the Nightstalkers, or whatever. It depends if he's going like more horror fandom or if he's going just like, you know, he's being a stand-up guy. Hmm. That is a good suggestion. The only problem with that suggestion is it makes, unfortunately, the culture is a very generic YouTube pile, which I think people will get. And I read the books a long time ago. I can't really remember them. But maybe. I'll put it on the docket for sure. Yeah, Night Laws. The thing where Trump posted like a fundraising email where the first line was, I want to go to heaven, made me like bark the loudest laugh I've done in my life, just alone in my room, doing this absolutely killed me. On that note, I'm going to turn off the podcast. Bye. At Golden Valley Brewery, we know good times come from time spent with friends along with great food.
