[00:00] Every big AI platform now remembers what
[00:03] you said in other chats. And that's a
[00:05] new development. This week, both Claude
[00:07] and Google's Gemini shipped a memories

[00:16] enabled by default, but you can check it
[00:18] if you go into your settings and this

[00:20] chats. Allow Claude to search for
[00:22] relevant details in past chats. And
[00:24] there's this simple prompt that they
[00:25] make you run when you log into Claude
[00:27] for the first time. Hi, Claude. what
[00:28] were some highlights from our recent
[00:29] conversations? And as you can see, it
[00:31] pulls up some of my recent conversations
[00:34] here. I really like how it shows you

[00:40] least, be aware that every platform
[00:42] between Chat GPT Claude and Gemini do
[00:44] this by default. Now,
