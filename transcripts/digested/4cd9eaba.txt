[00:00] Welcome back to the AI daily brief.
[00:02] Today we are talking about a really
[00:03] interesting and important phenomenon.
[00:05] Some findings from a recent survey that
[00:07] suggest that when it comes to AI,
[00:09] employees do not trust their workplaces
[00:12] right now. However, before we get into
[00:14] that, I want to contextualize this in a
[00:16] broader conversation around the state of
[00:18] AI in jobs right now. A big theme for
[00:21] the last couple of months has been
[00:22] whether or not and the extent to which
[00:24] we're starting to see AI show up in job
[00:26] displacement particularly around young
[00:28] workers. You might remember back earlier
[00:31] in the year when anthropic CEO Dario
[00:33] Amade warned that AI could end up
[00:34] eliminating half of entry-level white
[00:36] collar jobs and giving his standing in
[00:38] the industry obviously there was a lot
[00:39] of discussion around that. So far, it's
[00:42] been a lot of tea leaf reading and
[00:44] theorizing. And so, I was interested to
[00:45] see this recent paper come out from
[00:47] Stanford University's human- centered
[00:48] artificial intelligence lab, or HAI. The
[00:51] paper took a targeted look at how early
[00:53] career workers between the ages of 22
[00:55] and 25 are being impacted by AI. Now,
[00:58] whether or not it is AI's fault, by some
[01:00] metrics, this has been the worst year to
[01:02] leave college since 2015. NBC recently
[01:05] published a piece called A Black Hole:
[01:07] New Graduates Discover a Dismal Job
[01:08] Market. They write, "NBC News asked
[01:11] people who recently finished technical
[01:12] school, college, or graduate school how
[01:14] their job application process was going.
[01:16] And in more than 100 responses, the
[01:17] graduates described months have spent
[01:19] searching for a job, hundreds of
[01:20] applications, and zero responses from
[01:22] employers." Now, obviously, a news
[01:24] outlet asking 100 people does not a
[01:26] comprehensive data set make. And yet,
[01:28] there's definitely a broader sentiment
[01:30] that this is happening in some ways. If
[01:33] you go on various community spaces
[01:35] online, you'll see people complaining
[01:36] about similar phenomenon. What's more,
[01:38] as NBC points out, the unemployment rate
[01:41] among recent grads has been increasing
[01:43] this year and is up to about 5.3% as
[01:45] compared to around 4% for the labor
[01:47] force as a whole. By the numbers, then
[01:49] it's one of the toughest job markets for
[01:50] new grads since 2015. Of course, what's
[01:53] difficult is to understand how much this
[01:55] is about AI specifically versus
[01:57] confounding factors like the reversal of
[02:00] hot tech hiring in 2021 or just general
[02:02] malaise in the private sector. Now, the
[02:05] Stanford paper does try to control for
[02:07] other factors to come up with a
[02:08] definitive answer on whether AI is
[02:10] already impacting the labor market and
[02:12] ultimately came to the conclusion that
[02:13] yes, AI is having an impact here. The
[02:16] paper highlighted several key findings.
[02:18] Their main one and the one that you've
[02:19] seen the most statistics probably shared
[02:20] on places like X is that early career
[02:23] workers entering fields that are highly
[02:25] exposed to AI disruption experienced a
[02:27] 13% relative decline in employment even
[02:30] after the data was controlled for firm
[02:32] level shocks. The researchers gave the
[02:34] examples of customer service
[02:35] representatives and software developers
[02:36] as some of the professions most exposed.
[02:39] In contrast, employment for workers in
[02:40] less exposed fields saw employment
[02:42] remain stable or even grow. The same was
[02:44] true for more experienced workers in
[02:45] occupations that are highly exposed to
[02:47] AI. You can see this chart that was
[02:49] shared by Mike Bird from The Economist
[02:51] that broke different groups into their
[02:53] exposure quintiles and seemed to find
[02:55] this pattern of higher AI exposure
[02:57] leading to lower job growth or actual
[02:59] job deceleration. The researchers also
[03:01] found that adjustments in the labor
[03:03] force are more likely to occur right now
[03:04] through headcount reduction rather than
[03:06] reduced compensation and reductions in
[03:08] the labor force were more likely in
[03:09] fields where AI was being used as
[03:11] automation rather than augmentation. In
[03:13] other words, and intuitively, voice
[03:15] agents taking over for call center
[03:16] workers is a challenge, but AI
[03:18] note-takers don't seem to pose much
[03:19] risk. Finally, the researchers said that
[03:21] these effects were still visible after
[03:23] controlling for several different
[03:24] factors and remaining consistent across
[03:26] alternate sample constructions. They
[03:28] said, "We find that the AI exposure
[03:30] taxonomy did not meaningfully predict
[03:31] employment outcomes for young workers
[03:33] further back in time before the
[03:34] widespread use of LLMs. The patterns we
[03:37] observe in the data appear most acutely
[03:38] starting in late 2022 around the time of
[03:41] rapid proliferation of generative AI
[03:43] tools. In other words, these patterns
[03:45] are new and at least correlated with the
[03:47] rise of AI." Now, for all of this, the
[03:49] paper is still careful to caveat that
[03:50] the results could be due to factors
[03:52] other than AI. Ultimately, they reduced
[03:54] their claim to state, "Our results are
[03:56] consistent with the hypothesis that
[03:58] generative AI has begun to affect
[04:00] entry-level employment." Still, looking
[04:02] into the data, it really does seem like
[04:04] there are a lot of confounding factors
[04:06] here. Marketing and sales managers is
[04:08] one of the occupations that researchers
[04:09] suggested was most impacted by AI.
[04:11] However, the biggest drop in junior
[04:13] hiring came in the last quarter of 2022.
[04:16] So then if you extend the logic of the
[04:18] paper, you'd have to be arguing that
[04:19] effectively chat GBT gets released in
[04:21] November and firms immediately stop
[04:23] hiring junior sales and marketing
[04:25] positions. If you ever use GBT3, you'll
[04:27] realize just how absurd that notion is.
[04:29] Hiring in that field also seemed to
[04:31] recover strongly in the second quarter
[04:33] of 2024 when the economy got out of its
[04:35] slump. The Contra example is also a
[04:38] little flawed with the researchers using
[04:39] nursing aids as the key example of an
[04:41] occupation where young hires are
[04:42] growing. It's probably true that nurses
[04:45] haven't been disrupted by AI, but that's
[04:47] also a field seeing a huge demand spike
[04:48] due to the aging occupation. This is of
[04:51] course not to argue that AI is having no
[04:52] effect, but to try to claim that because
[04:55] we are starting to see these patterns in
[04:57] young employment, the only or even main
[04:59] causal factor still might not just be
[05:02] AI. Ultimately, we are still very much
[05:04] in the vibes and sentiment stage of
[05:06] this, not the hard data stage. And I do
[05:09] think that as opposed to some recent
[05:11] so-called studies from top universities
[05:13] that make big bold pronouncements about
[05:15] AI, in this case, the Stanford group is
[05:18] just trying to get a little bit of color
[05:20] to start to try to see some signal
[05:23] through what is ultimately very noisy
[05:25] and immature data. I think it's also
[05:27] important that anytime we talk about AI
[05:29] job loss, we also talk about jobs that
[05:31] AI will create. And this is not just me
[05:33] bllightly being an industry advocate,
[05:35] although I've certainly been accused of
[05:37] worse in my life. It's that anytime we
[05:39] talk about job displacement from new
[05:41] technology. It's so much easier for us
[05:44] to understand what things that we do now
[05:47] that new technology will be able to do
[05:48] instead of us as opposed to what new
[05:51] things we don't even consider doing now
[05:53] that technology will create the
[05:54] opportunity for. That is definitionally
[05:57] in the future and harder if not
[05:58] impossible to know. And on that front, a
[06:00] new report from staffing firm Birch
[06:02] Works found that AI specific roles are
[06:05] absolutely on fire. The report found
[06:07] that base salaries for non-managerial
[06:09] workers in AI with 0 to three years of
[06:11] experience grew by 12% over the past
[06:13] year. Birch Works analyzed the
[06:14] compensation of thousands of AI and data
[06:16] science candidates to come up with these
[06:18] numbers. The report also found that
[06:20] people with AI experience are being
[06:21] promoted to management roles roughly
[06:23] twice as fast as their counterparts in
[06:24] other tech fields. Anil K. Gupta, a
[06:27] professor at the University of
[06:28] Maryland's business school, said there
[06:29] is a significant salary difference
[06:31] between a machine learning engineer job
[06:33] and a software engineer job. The WSJ
[06:35] added some anecdot
[06:38] to confirm. He said that he plans to
[06:40] triple graduate hires this year in part
[06:42] for their AI skills. He said they're
[06:44] going to come in. They're going to be
[06:45] all AI native. We can't for the life of
[06:47] us get the more senior people to adopt
[06:49] it. Now, interestingly, at the
[06:51] enterprise AI event that I was speaking
[06:53] at this week in Vegas, a lot of the
[06:55] conversation in some of the breakout
[06:56] sessions was about this phenomenon. I
[06:58] heard a lot of the people who were here
[07:00] in positions of power, CIOS and the like
[07:02] talk about how they were really excited
[07:04] about young people who were more AI
[07:06] native coming in and helping bring that
[07:08] skill set and that mindset to the
[07:10] organization. I think there is an
[07:12] awareness that many firms are going to
[07:14] treat junior workers like they are not
[07:16] important anymore because of AI and some
[07:18] other opportunistic firms are going to
[07:19] swoop in, treat them really well and
[07:22] potentially get the benefits. All of
[07:24] which brings us to this interesting
[07:25] conversation around the relationship
[07:27] between workers and their employers when
[07:29] it comes to AI. If you're not familiar
[07:31] with Kyla Scandlin, she is a economics
[07:34] focused content creator who's got a big
[07:36] following on Tik Tok and on other social
[07:38] media and does a great job of explaining
[07:40] and breaking down important economic and
[07:42] market concepts in a way that
[07:43] non-professionals can understand. A
[07:45] couple of days ago on her blog, she
[07:47] published a survey that she had run
[07:48] called AI that works for workers. She
[07:51] writes, "AI is at least four different
[07:53] transformations happening simultaneously
[07:55] in how we work, how we invest, how we
[07:57] power our world, and how nations
[07:58] compete. were trying to integrate an
[08:00] unpredictable technology into systems
[08:02] that weren't designed for it. What's
[08:03] happening in this messy middle? I wanted
[08:06] to know how people felt about AI. What
[08:08] do workers think about working alongside
[08:09] these new systems? So, I asked them
[08:11] directly. So, basically, this is a
[08:13] self-conducted survey. It is not a
[08:15] Stanford survey. It's not even an MIT
[08:17] survey. But, Kyla has a big following
[08:19] and she got,200 people to respond to the
[08:21] survey within 24 hours. As she puts it,
[08:24] the entire goal here is exploratory
[08:26] research. This is more meant to be a
[08:27] preliminary exploration of how people
[08:29] are thinking during this time of immense
[08:30] change than to produce declarative
[08:32] conclusions. The survey that Kyla shared
[08:34] had 11 questions. How familiar are you
[08:36] with AI tools in your industry? Have you
[08:38] used AI at work in the past 6 months?
[08:40] What's the biggest benefit you hope AI
[08:42] could bring to your work? What are your
[08:43] biggest concerns about AI at work? What
[08:45] role should workers have in decisions
[08:46] about how AI is implemented? How much do
[08:48] you trust your employer or organization
[08:50] to use AI in ways that benefit workers?
[08:52] Has your employer provided training on
[08:54] how to use AI tools? If you could enact
[08:56] one policy to ensure AI benefits and
[08:58] compliments workers, what would it be?
[09:00] And then finally, what industry are you
[09:01] in? Are you a member of a union? And any
[09:03] additional thoughts? She writes, "The
[09:06] responses largely showed a workforce
[09:08] that's not totally enthusiastic nor
[09:10] completely resistant, but they are
[09:11] actively thinking through what it means
[09:13] to work alongside intelligence that
[09:14] isn't quite human, but isn't really
[09:16] predictable either." Now, there is a lot
[09:19] of interesting stuff in this survey,
[09:21] which by the way, you can go check out
[09:22] at kila.substack.com.
[09:24] That's ky laa.sub. substack.com. But by
[09:27] and large, the thing that I found
[09:28] interesting was the utter lack of trust
[09:31] that employees have with their employers
[09:33] when it comes to this technology. Now,
[09:36] this is not the first time that we've
[09:37] seen there be a gap between employees
[09:40] and executives when it comes to AI
[09:42] policy. A number of times on this show,
[09:44] I've shared this survey from writer that
[09:46] was conducted last December that
[09:48] surveyed 800 employees and 800 seuite
[09:50] executives and saw frankly a huge gap
[09:53] between how they were thinking about AI
[09:54] in their own companies. When asked
[09:56] whether they thought that their company
[09:57] had been successful in adopting AI over
[09:59] the previous 12 months, 75% of
[10:01] executives said that they had versus
[10:02] only 45% of employees. In fact, when it
[10:05] came to the simple question of just
[10:06] asking whether their company had an AI
[10:08] strategy, whereas 89% of executives
[10:11] said, "Yes, of course we do." Only 57%
[10:13] of employees said the same. Now, there
[10:15] are all sorts of interesting places that
[10:17] this lack of trust is showing up and
[10:19] suggesting that there are real problems
[10:20] here. That same survey found that 41% of
[10:23] Gen Z employees are sabotaging their
[10:25] company's generative AI strategy and
[10:26] that of the people who are, a third of
[10:28] them are worried about AI diminishing
[10:30] their value or their creativity. Point
[10:32] being, there appear to be big chunks of
[10:34] people inside companies who are very
[10:36] much not on board with AI strategy. And
[10:39] it's understandable why. If you think
[10:40] that when a company is pushing an agent
[10:42] on you, they're basically asking you to
[10:44] just train your replacement, you're not
[10:45] going to be all that enthusiastic about
[10:47] it. Which is not to say that there
[10:48] aren't things that people want out of
[10:50] AI. When Kyla asked what workers hope AI
[10:53] will do for them, 29% said that they
[10:55] want it to reduce repetitive work and
[10:57] 27% said they want it to increase
[10:59] efficiency. And yet they worry that it
[11:01] could shrink their opportunities and
[11:02] that the early state could actually
[11:04] impact negatively the quality of their
[11:06] work. 18% said, for example, that they
[11:08] were concerned about fewer career
[11:10] opportunities. Still, as I said, to me,
[11:12] the most interesting numbers were around
[11:13] the trust or lack thereof between
[11:15] employees and their companies when it
[11:17] came to AI. The chart that you're
[11:19] looking at shows a breakdown by industry
[11:21] of how workers rated how much they trust
[11:23] their employer to use AI in ways that
[11:25] benefit them, the workers. On the more
[11:28] trustful end of the spectrum, you had
[11:29] the healthcare industry. 10% of workers
[11:32] in that industry said that they
[11:33] completely trust their employer and 61%
[11:36] said that they had some trust. 29% said
[11:39] that they had no trust. Now, I will
[11:41] pause here to note that in the most
[11:43] trusting industry, there were still
[11:45] about 30% of people, just under a third,
[11:47] who had no trust in their employer to
[11:49] use AI in ways that benefit them. On the
[11:52] other end of the spectrum, we have the
[11:53] real estate industry where 0% completely
[11:56] trusted their employer to use AI in ways
[11:57] that benefit them and only 44% had some
[12:00] trust as opposed to 56% who had no
[12:03] trust. The vast majority of industries
[12:05] here had over a third of people with no
[12:09] trust in their employer to use AI in
[12:11] ways that are beneficial to them as
[12:12] opposed to just for the company. And
[12:14] just under half of them have over 40%
[12:17] saying that they have no trust. So, if
[12:19] you are an executive and thinking about
[12:21] 2026 and how you get AI working inside
[12:23] your organization, it may be useful to
[12:26] consider what your employees currently
[12:28] think about how your organization is
[12:29] going about things. Now, part of the
[12:31] reason that people might not be trustful
[12:33] is that it doesn't necessarily really
[12:34] seem like they're being supported when
[12:36] it comes to AI. The vast majority of
[12:38] workers, for example, in this study, had
[12:40] never received any training on AI. The
[12:42] two industries that had the greatest
[12:44] percentage of people responding that
[12:45] they had received some training was the
[12:47] technology industry. itself and
[12:49] consulting and in those cases it was
[12:52] still only around 60/40 of people who
[12:54] had been trained to people who hadn't in
[12:56] consulting it was 5842 that means that
[12:59] in consulting an industry that is so
[13:01] poised for disruption or at least
[13:03] radical change from AI you still have
[13:06] 42% of workers who had never received
[13:08] any training from their employees on AI
[13:10] tools and by the way they want it when
[13:12] asked for their thoughts on what their
[13:14] employer could do to increase their
[13:15] comfort with AI and their positive
[13:17] relationships with AI training and
[13:19] upskilling funds was the top answer. To
[13:21] me, it seems inevitable that the more
[13:23] that our focus turns to agents and
[13:26] especially highly complex agents or
[13:28] systems of agents that can do bigger and
[13:29] bigger chunks of work, the more that
[13:31] you're going to see human employees push
[13:33] back and demand to have a seat at the
[13:34] table. Now, the opportunity, of course,
[13:36] is that for forward-thinking
[13:37] organizations, while other organizations
[13:39] wait too long and struggle with things
[13:41] like employee sabotage, organizations
[13:44] that actually get their people on board,
[13:46] that paint a vision for how AI and
[13:48] agents are going to work at their
[13:49] company and what the implications are
[13:51] for their existing employees, those
[13:53] organizations are just going to so
[13:55] dramatically outperform those that don't
[13:56] do that. Of course, we are still living
[13:59] in a der of real data, but as long as
[14:01] the vibes keep rolling in, we will
[14:02] keeping track of them. For now, that is
[14:04] going to do it for today's AI daily
[14:06] brief.
