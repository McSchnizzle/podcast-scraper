[00:00] I love Tiny Desk and I got to thinking
[00:01] about all the artists I'd want to see on
[00:03] Tiny Desk and you know of course some of
[00:05] them are no longer able to be on Tiny
[00:07] Desk because they're not alive anymore.
[00:09] So that got me thinking about how I
[00:11] could do a notorious B.I. Christopher
[00:13] Wallace tiny desk and do we have the
[00:15] tools and technologies and of course can
[00:17] we do it in a way that's respectful and
[00:18] not derivative and I did it and it
[00:21] seemed like it kind of worked and the
[00:22] workflow is pretty simple. I actually
[00:24] found a Biggie cover band playing live
[00:26] in Brooklyn and I pulled that down from
[00:28] YouTube. Then I extracted the actual
[00:31] vocals from the notorious B.I. and laid
[00:33] them over. To all the ladies in the
[00:35] place with style and grace, allow me to
[00:37] lace these miracle dishes.
