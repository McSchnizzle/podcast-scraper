[00:00] So recently there was a breakthrough in
[00:01] AI with this so-called world generator.
[00:04] They look insane. They allow you to
[00:05] generate entire computer games in what's
[00:08] essentially real time. And now there's
[00:09] an open source version of that. So if
[00:11] you have a $3,000 graphics card, you
[00:13] could actually be running this Matrix
[00:14] game 2.0 on your computer that looks
[00:17] something like this. Now mind you, this
[00:19] is not a game. All of this is AI
[00:20] generating the entire environment in
[00:22] real time, which leaves the question
[00:24] open. So this is version one. Once we're
[00:26] on version 35, what's the difference
[00:28] between this and reality?
