Hello, good evening, and welcome to this very special Friday live stream. I'm your host, Jason Miles, here for another episode of this Revolution Podcast. While this is a special Friday show, we will be back again at our regular time at 9 a.m. Pacific, where I'll be joined by the TIR crew to discuss cultural appropriation. It will be fun, I promise. So, if you dig this listener-supported programming we have here on TIR, think about becoming a patron for as little as $3 a month or $30 for the year, you can make sure TIR can continue this breakneck pace of shows. Now, today we're talking about Howard Stern. Calling it quits. Rumors are swirling around the possible end of an era. Howard Stern, longtime shock jock, satellite radio king, and architect of late night irreverence, may be nearing the close of his serious XM run. His five-year $500 million contract, roughly about $100 million per year, is set to expire later this year. And reports suggest the company is more interested in keeping his archives than paying for new shows. Whether this is the final curtain or a high-stakes negotiation, the media landscape he once dominated has shifted dramatically. Stern was more than a radio host, he was a cultural force, and for decades, the leader of what will be called a culture of callousness. His show became a parade of porn stars, tabloid train wrecks, rock stars, and celebrities at their lowest points. Perhaps the most tragic example was Dana Plato, former Different Strokes child star, who appeared on Stern's program in 1999, fielding relentless mockery from both him and his callers. The very next day, she died by suicide. Stern's brand of humor was often self-deprecating, but it also was merciless, and that cruelty was part of the entertainment. Even as Stern mellowed in later years, becoming a more reflective interviewer, the damage was done. Cruelty as mass market humor had been normalized, and the shot jock sensibility seeped into everything from talk radio to reality TV to social media. The question now isn't whether Stern is leaving Sirius XM, it's whether the end of his career would mark the end of an era or simply leave the field to new. Inheritors of his brand, Callousness. With us tonight is journalist Ross Bennis, author of 1999, The Year of Low Culture. We'll explore Stern's legacy, his role in shaping late 90s and early 2000s lowbrow entertainment, and whether the culture he helped unleash can ever really fade. Please welcome returning guest and author of a great book, Ross Bennis. Hey, good to be here. What's going on, Ross? How are you? I love the applause. Maybe I'll ask for an ovation at the end. Right? It gets you fired up, right? Yeah, yeah. We're going to fucking talk some hard Stern. Now, you are an East Coaster and you grew up with Stern on the radio, or was he already on the radio? So I live in the East Coast now. I grew up in the Midwest, but I'm in Nebraska. You're from Nebraska. Yeah. But I did grow up with Stern's private parts. The movie. Yeah, like I was probably like 10 years old when I first saw it. And my friends' older brothers were watching it. And I had the hardest little boner when that woman is like on the speaker and he's making it vibrate. That's like my biggest Stern memory. But you were a fan of the show, or more so the movie. Because the movie, well, I guess the movie is him. It's his life. Yeah, and I was exposed to the show because it was on, I think it was on E, the TV version. I know that's it was a little edited compared to what you would do on the radio, but I was very familiar with Howard. And I liked how crass he was. You know, now those shock jocks are associated with right-wing stuff, but I just felt it was like a sexual provocateur. It's interesting that you say that because he was, for me, one of the first people that had porn stars on regularly on his show. Howard Stern has been called both a trailblazer and a cultural bottom feeder. How should his influence be remembered, in your opinion? You know, when he got a show on E, he, I think it was during Upfronts Week when the TV Network gave these big presentations at advertisers. It was either Upfronts or some big conference. And he was like, I'm going to do my part to make sure that TV stays a vast wasteland because the FCC commissioner from years past said TV is like a vast wasteland. And he lived up to that expectation. So I think Howard's very innovative. I mean, he pioneers a lot of what other talk show hosts would do on FM and AM radio. I think he becomes influential in how Jerry Springer and some of those other TV talk show hosts structure their show. He, you know, like what he does with taking a show then to TV, like you have so many people, especially sports radio, like Mike and Mike and all these ESPN guys that kind of did what Howard did. No one did that before. Jim Rome. Yeah. And then going to satellite radio, like every time he's done something like that, he's kind of been the first or one of the first to do it. He's been on top of the game and he's usually ahead of it. Which I think, regardless of how you view the man, I do think that's an important thing to remember: that he didn't really change the setup for television. It was literally you were just watching the studio, which, if you think about it, radio is this awesome thing where your imagination still runs wild when people are in the studio, especially when you would have the porn people in there doing God knows what, right? So to hear it and then to see it is so different because by the time people like Rome got on TV, Jim Rome, for example, who's probably the biggest name in sports media, maybe Colin Cowherd is a close second, but Jim Rome has dominated sports radio media and television for probably about as long as Howard Stern has. And Jim Rome's first show is a talk show format where they moved him out of the radio studio into a talk show format. Famously, he's punched in the nose by quarterback Jim Everett for calling him Chris Everett because he said he threw off his back foot. And Jim Rome embodies a lot of the sternness too by kind of being tell it like it is. He's intentionally agitating people. Yes. Yes. That's very stern-like. And from the way. West Coast, I think Mike and Mike are so East Coast guys that even their rudeness is taken as that's just the way those people are. They have the accents. You're allowed to be a little rude when you talk like those two. But Jim Rome is from San Diego, right? And he sounds like it. I was just thinking, you're talking about Howard Stern. He'd have the, he'd have it on TV after he was on, he would broadcast on TV after he had it on radio. And you're saying they'd have him do go, no, God knows what. He had a porn star in 1999, Johnny Toxic, come on and just start intentionally puking everywhere. Like, well, that's a weird thing to do for radio. You're just listening to a guy puke. And people find that's like gross and irritating, but captivating. You know, I think he had a lot of hate listeners. That was another thing. He got people who despise him and they're going to listen to him because they despise him. And which gets us into what we're going to have in this moment where it's like, I hate watched blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Any hate listeners out here? Anyone hate Jason? Tune in for this? Don't inspire these motherfuckers though. There's always someone that has horrible things to say. And I'm like, why do you watch it every week if you're going to just say horrible shit every time? I don't know. I'm doing something right, I guess. Do you think Stern's a product of his time? Or does he really shape the media landscape of the 90s and 2000s? No, that's, I think he shapes the landscape to a degree. Because he, there's others that are like shock jocks. There are others who are crude, but he's just so popular with that talk show format that I think he influences what comes after him. And like I said, it's also on TV, too. He starts out as a radio guy, but I see a lot of Stern stuff in like Springer and Ricky and you know, all those 90s talk shows. I they were kind of picking up what he was doing because he was doing it before they were. TV talk had been around a while, but like until Morton Downey, probably it hadn't been tabloid like Stern's show is. And even Morton Downey is still Morton Downey to me would fit in so well in this podcast era, political podcast era, that I look at a lot of shows today, even especially ones I don't like. And I'm like, you're just a derivative of Morton Downey. Yeah. You know, the way this older guy resonated with young people. Kind of like Stern in a way, right? Because Stern is not a young man, but his listener base was much younger. It's not like he was trying to talk to people of his generation. What about him resonated for you as a much younger man? He didn't take himself seriously. And he was actually a pretty good interviewer. And I think you've seen that as he's pivoted. Like, he doesn't have porn stars on his show now. It's usually celebrities or politicians or, you know, it's someone you already know. But even if the person he's having on is some no-name person or it's someone who's doing like, you know, porn or something shocking, he would give them like a serious interview. Like he would give the porn star the same treatment that he would give an A-list celebrity if they dropped it. And he got, he was good at getting them to talk. Now, like, a lot of it would just be like him being kind of an asshole to them or asking like a woman to show her tits or something. Like, but he got the conversation flowing in a way that I don't think other talk shows did if they were like just sitting there asking serious questions in a stay format. We can't talk about Howard Stern without talking about this. Our mutual friend, uh, JG Michael had uh made a social media post about this. Dana Plato, the Dana Plato interview remains one of maybe the most infamous moments of Stern's career. And I don't know if he has any regrets about that. Uh, what does it reveal about his ethics or the shock jock entertainment at large? You know, I actually haven't seen the Dana Plato interview, which is an omission on my part. So, you know, you might have to describe to the listeners. Dana Plato had just got busted. I think this is when she robbed a video store. So, if you do you know who Dana Plato is, by the way, Ross, vaguely, actress. I don't know. Okay. There was a show in the 80s because Ross is a little younger. Guys, so don't make fun of him. It's just the it's youth, you can't get mad at youth. Um, there was a show in the 80s that ran for about five or six years called Different Strokes, and it's the show that launched. I've seen Different Strokes. Okay, so Dana Plato was the daughter of the rich father. She later was going to have a spin-off of her own. That spin-off became Facts of Life. That's actually supposed to be where she went to school, and she doesn't star in Facts of Life, but the maid, Miss Garrett, Charlotte Ray, leaves and does facts of life with those people. And that show lasts another seven, eight years. But Dana Plato probably had some of the worst drug problems of the Different Strokes cast. And we're kind of living in a day where we're keeping track of stars a lot more. And we have television that we follow and we want to know their whereabouts. I don't think Dana Plato would have made it, or maybe she would have turned into Lindsay Lohan and kept something going for longer if she lived in the era of social media. But she had couldn't get a job, fallen on some hard times, done an adult film. When I say adult film, I mean like Cinemax kind of adult film, I forget what it's called. And then she had like robbed a liquor store. And the reason why she got caught is because the person said, you're that girl from that TV show. Like, damn. And this is one of those things that famous people talk about. We can't get regular jobs because then we'll never get roles again. Yeah. Because once you're recognized as you know, the waiter, well, you're never going to get a role again. And she had claimed she was clean off drugs. She was not. And Howard Stern and the callers, remember, he's screening these calls, just ripped into her for being a loser and a drug addict. And her whole thing was, no, I didn't do drugs. And I'm so clean that you can take a sample of my hair and test it. And they were like, okay, we're totally going to do that. We're going to find drugs. And they did. And they just kept fucking with her and fucking with her. I don't think he's solely responsible. JG does. I do think if she was on the ledge, they gave her a pretty good push right off. And she does kill herself the next day. Wow. If you're already in that spot, going on the Howard Stern show is a risky proposition because, like, he's, you know, he's not, he's not Oprah. He's just going to be provocative, I feel like, no matter what the situation is. But that's a crazy story. That's a hole that I wasn't familiar with all that. You know, it's so sad that it's part of the Dana Plato made-for-TV movie that she's so crestfallen because also she's looking at going on the Howard Stern show as a way to maybe show the business that she can do it again. Right? And I just don't think she could take the abuse. Now, I don't know if Howard Stern has pulled that episode. I wouldn't doubt it if he did. I've never went to go look for it because it's kind of sad seeing someone at that point of their life. But that's also kind of who Howard Stern dealt with to a certain degree, a certain kind of person that you can make fun of that we felt, oh, we can make fun of this guy, which I don't know if you can do that the same way. And in all fairness, he seemed to have grown out of it in the last 15, maybe even 20 years or so. Well, his show is been different in the last like at least 10 years. Like I said, he's like going to have on Hillary Clinton now or some huge celebrity. And he's not going to just like have the callers come in and just rip some C-list celebrity to pieces or porn stars. He used to have the insane clown posse all the time, which, you know, I'm a fan of. But his show on Sirius is different than his show was like in the 80s and 90s on New York radio. He's also fucking older, though. Like he's like 70 years old now. Yeah, yeah. Like I said, I think who he is now is a lot different. I think when he got the Sirius deal, I think it was different. I think maybe the Sirius deal marks a moment in his life where he's like, I want to get away from being that radio. Guy, yeah, and be a little more calm and see what that's like and talk to people I want to talk to. It's funny now seeing him portrayed, especially by Trump and others, as being this, like you know, he's this like you know, left-leaning loser. He's like, you know, such a like an Patsy for the Democrats. And I'm just thinking, like, when he was in the 90s, when he was at his peak, he was just like being terrible to women. That was like his thing. But now he's treated so differently now. He defended his style as just comedy. For you, at what point, and this is kind of a big thing, I think, for this era. And we can tie this into something that's going on right now. And I think this is kind of important. Mark Marin is going around on his podcast tour. JG and I talked a little bit about this yesterday, condemning, let's just call it the Rogan Sphere comics that he doesn't feel is edgy because they want to be anti-woke. And there's this thing where people are saying, is Marin trying to bring woke back? And I don't think he is. But at what point does just comedy become cruelty for you? I have a pretty high bar for that. So the Dana Plato thing you're describing sounds cruel, even though I'm not super familiar with the incident. Yeah, when someone's on stage, man, I'm having trouble thinking of an example where I'd say that's just cruel. I kind of think anything's fair game, especially in comedy. You know, I think the biggest thing you do is don't watch that person, um, you know, checking them out. Um, but I know a lot of people feel differently and they want their comedy uh to fall within certain parameters. But that's part of the reason why I think there's a lot of people who feel that it um there isn't much of a bar. That's why like Chappelle resonated so much with his latest specials, even though they didn't actually that great, like they weren't like his early stuff, but it just felt like he was pushing back against um you know the idea of reigning comedy back in to be more polite. I don't know, I thought some of that shit was pretty fucking funny. I liked it, but I thought like killing them softly and shit like that was like which one was killing themself. Was that like the early 2000s? That's early 2000s. Yeah, I thought that newer shit was way better than that. Okay, well, we're on different. I like it all, but I like the stuff from 20 years ago better. The last few didn't hit because I think he's responding to the internet. It's like, why do you care? But um, Sticks and Stones was the best of the like the second one, I think so. He did like three, right? Three or four, three or four, yeah. I don't remember off the top of my head. We should, this is where you get Ben Burgess in here because then is a Chappellologist. Yeah, um, I get where Marin is coming from with the Roganverse, and I think the Roganverse kind of blew up in the podcast sphere. Um, but if you listen to those people's shows, they're not that political, right? They just kind of tell debaucherous comic stories to make their lives sound cooler, like dude, we're doing drugs and there's sex and drugs. Like, that's kind of all you hear with those shows. So, um, I guess I get where he's coming with their comedy, but I don't know too many people that are like, Hey, we're going to go see Theo Vaughn live. Uh, I didn't know people that saw Theo Vaughn 10 years ago, maybe you did, but no, it's only recently that I've even become aware of him, really, like in the last few years. He's been a comic for I know, I know, but I, it wasn't on my radar. This is not funny, this wasn't really a lot of it's right-wing coded too, based on the guests that they bring in. Like, if he's gonna have JD Vance on, um, it's gonna seem that way, yeah. But I mean, they're not gonna talk about policy as a person that wrote a book about the late 90s. I'm sure you watched some comedy, and this person kind of falls more within the late 80s, early 90s. But Andrew Dice Clay was a massive comic that kind of had one trick. Hey, old mother hubbard, I fucked up toe, right? Um, but he could do that over and over again because we didn't live sold out arenas doing that, the same joke, yeah. Um I don't remember people giving that much of a shit about Andrew Dice Clay. Maybe there was some outrage back then. There was a little bit, but again, he got to a certain point where he was doing arenas and then he wasn't. You can only tell the same joke so many times. A lot of those arena comics, like they can't only keep that going for so long. You know, what's Dane Cook been doing? Like, suing his brother, sadly. Damn. It's like he was-I mean, not he's not like Dice Clay necessarily, but he was huge. Like, I don't know if that was probably 15, 17 years ago, something like that. Closer to 20 years ago. 20 years ago. He's the first wave of MySpace, and he's the first to admit that he used MySpace to blow the hell up. Yeah. But that didn't, that like era of him selling out arenas didn't last that long. You can't really do that forever because eventually you're going to pivot. Like people forget Carrot Top was playing big rooms and you got a movie deal and the movie didn't do well. And he got a Vegas residency and that did quite well. He's a very rich man because of it. But when I think of comics that did big arenas, I don't know too many quote-unquote safe ones. Like he was doing, like, again, being a comic is almost a stepping stone to movies or writing. And some of those guys could do, like, you know, I'm sure Chris Rock could sell out arenas now if he wanted to, but like that doesn't actually seem like the best venue to do comedy. Like, it's a better setting if you're in a theater that's like 1,500 people versus being in a basketball arena that's 15,000 people. And then he's going, you know, going to do movies and other shit anyways. Yeah, that's the thing. It's like comedy is a stepping stone to other things. Like, who wants to tell jokes in a room alone? Steve Martin was like the most popular stand-up comic of all time in the 70s. Selling tons of records. Yeah. And doing arenas. And then he just gave it up and did all of his other shit, like his movies and writing and banjo playing. He like he walked away from that at the peak of it because he just didn't want to continue to do that forever. It's a hard business. Oh, yeah. Demanding. And you can't sit in that kind of, there's a, there's a Mr. I don't know if you've ever watched Mr. Show. Yep. Okay. There's a Mr. Show sketch about Ronnie Dobbs. David Cross. Yeah. And he plays a character named Ronnie Dobbs, who's who's kind of a stereotype of white guys that get caught on the show Cops. And he gets famous for being caught all over the world doing white trashy shit, yelling at his wife, having cocaine all over himself, and arresting him becomes this thing that cops want to do because he's such a famous icon and he gets a mansion and then he kind of loses the desire to be a redneck. And that's how the thing ends. But there's something to be said about achieving a certain level of success and then expecting people. Eddie Murphy to me is a perfect example. Like that guy didn't take him that long at all from being like a teenage, aspiring stand-up comic to then the biggest movie star recognizable in the world for a while. And now he's just, you know, super calm in his house recording reggae records that no one's ever going to hear. Hey, he's had an interesting career. I think it's crazy that he's come back and done these movies after not having done for a little while. And then he's doing like one with Pete Davidson of all things. Yeah. I haven't seen it yet. Have you seen it? I haven't yet. Eddie Murphy was my favorite. I think Eddie Murphy kicked in this door. Like we talk about black cinema and what kind of killed the super N-word. And Spike Lee definitely tried, but I think nothing killed it like Eddie Murphy in 48 hours when he comes in that bar with all the rednecks and says there's a new sheriff in town. I'm an N-word with a gun. I don't give a fuck. That was like the coolest thing in the world for me to hear as a little kid. I was like reeled in Eddie Murphy because he was cool. He didn't have to coon and he was like cool funny. Like Beverly Hills cop for me is hilarious. I don't know if oh yeah, those that move Beverly Hills. Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours. Those are great. Coming to America. Love all that shit. The Raw special. Yeah. But, you know, apparently he still does comedy, but he just doesn't do it for the public because I think he's uncomfortable. But I don't know if you watched any of his accepted speech when he won like a Mark Twain prize. Did you see that? Last thing I saw of him being interviewed was on Comedians and Cars getting coffee. Oh, was it funny? It wasn't that. It was okay. Those episodes are kind of hit and miss. Jerry's chemistry. And the actually the worst episode of Comedians and Cars I've seen was his one with Howard Stern. They seemed like they just hated each other by the end of it. Really? Do you think it was a bit? I think it just was awkward between them. Like Stern was kind of trying to be funny, and Jerry didn't seem to buy it as much. And they just seemed kind of annoyed. Maybe it was a bit. If it was a bit, though, it wasn't a very compelling one. Like it was just, it was kind of a boring episode. It's like, oh, these guys aren't riffing off each other at all. Going back to Howard Stern, Stern once represented a cutting edge of uncensored subscription-based content. How has that space evolved in the streaming podcast era where everything is free? It's a lot harder to sell subscriptions. I know people do it. I've been on shows even that like it'll be subscription-based to get that particular episode. But that is, yeah, that's tough when everything's free and everything's all over the place. It's harder to have exclusivity now than it was even just a few years ago. Like a few, if you like, Spotify signed all those deals. The biggest one was Rogan when they were going to be exclusive and only on Spotify. And that didn't last. Like, a lot of those people got cut loose. And then, even with Rogan, like, you, his stuff's on YouTube and elsewhere. Yeah. So, because you still want to grow the audience, even if that's a talent that you're representing. So, I to have a subscription, I feel like you need to be like kind of niche and be hitting a very specific itch for those viewers. If you're like a mass mainstream sort of show and you're just reaching as many people as possible, there's no way you're going to sell a subscription. Like New Heights with the Kelsey Brothers, like that wouldn't work well as a subscription. You know what I mean? Hmm. You're making me think of music festivals. You know, working Coachella and then working something like EDC is amazingly different because EDC actually has more people that show up than Coachella in a much smaller area. So almost 200,000 people concentrated in a freaking racing track in the late spring in Las Vegas compared to 100, maybe 15,000, 20,000 people. I know that attendance is slightly going back up to where it was when I was there six, seven years ago. And one of the things I noticed was you were guaranteed a certain kind of attendance when it was a niche show. If it was a rave, you're going to sell it out every time. Nobody would drink, but you're definitely going to sell it out every time. If it was a specific kind of music genre event, sometimes those things would work a little better than trying to have the all-encompassing thing. Because A, that just costs a lot of money, and we don't live in an era of mass culture anymore. So, what does everybody dig? That's the bigger question. Well, because you could go after people who are really into that thing, even if it's not the most popular thing out. If you're going niche, like that, I think those niche interests are the ones that are the strongest with people. Like, because you're hitting something that's kind of tailor-made for your interests. That's way different than the sitcom that 40 million people watch casually. Ready for a podcast that moves you to action?

How do you feel about that change? For the most part, I think it's good because it has more people. Producing programming allows more different flavors of programming to appeal to like interests or voices that weren't being heard before. The downside is there isn't like the water cooler pop culture as much outside of some sports. The NFL is like as popular as any sport has been in my lifetime in America. Yeah, it's still pretty popular. We did a show about that Wednesday about streaming and the NFL. If you guys want to check that out, we actually talk about kind of my fears about where the NFL is going because it is the last big cultural moment. The cultural commons, if you will, is being enclosed by venture capital and streaming services that are just mining data. So you are laboring in your leisure. They also have a stake now in ESPN. Yep. Yep. Kind of a conflict of interest there. We went into all of it. You should check out the show, Ross. I forgot that you're a sports guy and you actually said that you would be down to join me on a sports show. I forgot that you said that. Yeah, I used to work for Deadspin back when it wasn't a piece of shit website and wrote sports stuff for all sorts of publications. College football is like the thing I'm most into. And that's just due to upbringing. Like if you're from Nebraska, that's like Lincoln is a the whole state goes to Lincoln on Saturday. Yeah. It's a thing. I witnessed it and it blew my mind and it's a hell of a party. I was there when Dominic and Sue was in his final year at Nebraska. Oh, nice. Yeah. I was in college then too. So probably we're at the same game. It was, I wasn't at the game. We were just outside. We were in Lincoln. There's a venue that we played in Lincoln that was pretty big. Was it the zoo? Keep going. There's like the zoo bar. There's the state theater. It wasn't state theater. There's another one. I swear they started with the Z, but not the zoo. Maybe it was the zoo. It's kind of like a theater. This is kill me. I'll think of it and then I'll ask you if that's it. Okay. God, what was the name of it? Because I'm getting Lincoln confused with Omaha, and these are two very different places. Platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Patreon have replaced radio as the main stage for edgy content. Would Stern's act still be shocking today, or would it just be lost in the noise? I don't think it'd be shocking. And part of the reason is for what the groundwork he laid and all these people who came after him who were influenced by him. It's hard to be shocking now. I like that someone says Old Deadspin was the only sports website they would read back in the day. Old Deadspin was great even before I wrote for them, like when Will Leach was there. That was good stuff. But anyways, I don't think Stern's stuff would be necessarily shocking today. I think he would fit in well, though. I think he would. And he would adapt. Yeah. You think the public's tolerance for mean humor has changed since Howard Stern's heyday? Yeah, there would be probably even, well, I don't know. He had a lot of outrage. I was going to say there'd be more outrage now, but I think about it. He had a lot of outrage at the time, too. And that was actually what propelled him a little bit. I think he got people to listen to him every time he was fined by the FCC. It was like a badge of honor to say, F you to the man. You know, let's go with this guy who's fighting back and giving him hell. My dog's name is Cooper. Saw the chat pop up on the screen for Cooper Cup. Did he win your fantasy league and you named your dog then? Yeah, he led the league in receptions. Cooper's a good guy. He gets mad when I'm working for too long because this is him nagging me because he wants me to play with him. Gotcha. I'll be done. Podbean, your message amplified.

Cooper's like, I want to hear shit about Howard Stern. Yeah. Go watch TV with him. That's what he's doing. He'll just do this shit for like 20 minutes. And usually it works because I'll just be like, all right, you've been nagging me. You want to sit on the couch with me? He's a good guy. That's an interesting thing you bring up about Howard Stern because I wonder how he would react. Because the internet is kind of also what you choose to see. So do you think he'd be one of those guys that just doesn't have social media? I don't even know if he has social media right now. Does he? I'm not aware of him having social media. I'm sure there's like accounts that exist for the show. Like there's probably like a Facebook page or something that Sirius operates, but I've never seen like Howard Stern himself tweeting or, you know, Facebook commenting on anything. Like, I just, I don't think he ever got into that. But if he was young in his career now, I feel like he would kind of have to. Like all those podcast guys that are huge, they're online. How would it change if he had to interact? Because that's the big reason as someone that's gotten to know some older bands. One of the reasons that Slayer quit, they're like, we don't want to do these fucking meet and greets. This isn't fun. We got to show up hella early. Yeah, they've been doing it for a long time. You know, yeah, it's, it's. It's less exciting when you're 60 versus like 25 or whatever. I also think it's not where you thought you were going to be in your career. Like, you're like, look, we've gotten to a certain point. We're playing this size room. We're getting this kind of money. But if we want to keep it going, we have to be ambassadors. And we never signed up to be ambassadors. We signed up to be pirates and badasses. And caring about what people say online, caring about what I say is antithetical to badassery. It's what PR people do. You know, but if Stern was like 35 now and fresh, he's just kind of getting his show to grow. I feel like these social media platforms would be a place where he could get the new callers to make fun of. Like it would be supplying him stuff to, you know, a little banter to talk about, but then also, you know, people don't probably call in now. I mean, like, like, you don't have a hotline for, you know, people to call his show. They would tweet at you or comment on your YouTube page. And that would be the replacement for that mechanism. Now, his interviews have shifted in tone in recent years, more long-form, emphatic, and celebrity-focused. Was this adaptation to the times, or do you think it's a betrayal of the original show? Yeah, he's definitely moved on from the original show. I wouldn't go as far as betrayal, but he's abandoned it. And you only want to do that probably for so long, though. I imagine that would get old doing the show that he did in the 90s. To be doing that in your late 60s everyday sounds exhausting as hell. Do you become Ron Jeremy at a certain point where you stop being kind of the cool porn guy just to creep? Yeah, probably. Yeah, Ron Jeremy, didn't he like that? Yeah, wasn't he like accused of assaulting a bunch of people? Yeah. I've never heard a good Ron Jeremy story. Yeah. I ran into it one time at the Rainbow in LA. Yikes. That's all I got to say. Isn't Ron Jeremy like fucking brain dead now or something like that? I think he tried to use it as an excuse on why he was just grabbing titties. Gotcha. You know, sometimes just got to grab titties. I'm old. Looking for my cane. Ron German. There was Ron Jermyn was the final participant in a stunt to see how many. So before Bonnie Blue, this is where I'm going with this. Before Bonnie blew, like, you know, fuck the most guys in a day or whatever. A bunch of women in the 90s porn stars tried to do that same thing. And most of them went on Howard Stern's show, including Annabelle Chong. So Annabelle Chong tried to bone the most dudes in a day. She talked about it on Howard Stern. She talked about it on Jerry Springer. That's the type of guest he would have. You know, come on my show and talk about how you're going to blow. 400 guys in a day, or whatever, and Ron Jermy was the final guy to do her. That was like what he wanted for that whole thing. He wanted he didn't want sloppy seconds, he wanted like sloppy, like 350ths where she's good and warmed up. Yeah, she knows what she's doing, she's got a form down. This is gonna happen. Someone just yelled out, Annabelle Chung, a fan, a fan of Miss Chung. He's been waiting, waiting for that name to be called. I think birds chirped a little louder in his neighborhood. Um, so but would he stay kind of in that porn realm? You think? Because that's still a realm that doesn't have a lot of outsiders in it. I feel like the porn world. It's like either you're a porn person or you're not. Maybe it's a comfort level for them and porn and porn. And Stern really was a guy that was not a porn guy, other than a fan of, yeah. He didn't come up in that world. Uh, the porn stars were easy booking for him, you know. They got something out of that too in the promotion of whatever the hell they were doing. Um, but now, um, yeah, I don't see porn stars on the biggest podcast now, like the porn stars were on show, like Stern's radio show. Like, Rogan doesn't have like no biggest OnlyFans person on or anything like that. But again, I think that goes to what you were saying earlier about people having a niche. And with Satellite Radio, part of Satellite Radio was the I think Playboy and Penthouse. Oh, yeah, porn stars. There's tons of podcasts too online of like about the porn industry. Yeah, yeah. And it seems like you know, it's just listen to porn on the radio. Like, we love dicks. Oh, dicks. We had like 12 dicks yesterday. It was great. There's different kinds of dicks. It's like a buffet. You ever have a dick buffet? I love a dick buffet. And you're like, who the fuck talks like this? I've heard women talk. Maybe you need like one day a week. Like, you have your sports show. You can have your porn show? Yeah, your porn show. I mean, look, if I could find someone in that world that wanted to talk about that world that way, where it was like extremely not honest, this show would shoot off into the stratosphere. Like whoever is gooning to the idea of fucking a porn chick talking about a dick buffet. You just need to find your dick buffet. That's all you need. Always searching for the dick buffet. Always. If Stern leaves serious, is podcasting a natural next step or would he struggle to compete in a crowded field? Yeah, podcasting would be the natural step. I think there's two other possible steps. One is just doing less or even retiring because he's fucking old. He's in his 70s now. Like he's just, he's been there, done that. But another is like instead of just continuing to do more of talk radio, and he's just done different deviant, you know, variations of it. Like now you're doing satellite talk radio. Now, now we're talking about podcasts, which is basically talk radio just on-demand listening. He could get back into TV producing. He had that show, Son of the Beach. You know, we've talked about the movie Private Parts. He, at his peak, he did some TV and film producing, sometimes based off of like his own life and career, but then other times he was just involved with the show that isn't about him whatsoever. And maybe that's of interest when you're not doing hours of radio programming all the time. But if I was him, I would just say, I own a big ass house in the Hamptons and I'm rich as fuck. I don't want to work anymore. That's what I would do. Well, you know, the office comes to mind when you say that. And I feel like every person that was on the office has an office podcast where they just talk about every episode they were on in the office. And the office lasts for what, like seven, eight? No, nine seasons, I think. Yeah, because they had a few after Corell last. Yeah. Yeah. David, the Spader years. Yeah, which were not, they were okay. He's, I think he's fucking a great actor. Yeah. He's so funny to me. James Spader, so he was so perfect for that role because I don't think he gave a damn because he was making shit up as he went along. It was hilarious. But with, is that what Howard Stern was? Would do just go through the archives and be like, you know, in 1994, this is what we did, and let's relive. That's the saddest option of all of them to me that he's just doing like the nostalgia fest of his um glory days. That's sadder to me than like if he like goes and has a podcast and just keeps producing shit like current shit. Yeah, because every time I see a clip of him, it's him talking to Metallica, and I'm like, How many times does he have Metallica on his show? He said Metallica on quite a bit, yeah. Metallica of when Ozzie was um like a healthy guy or healthier, yeah. I feel like him or Sharon, like he had the Osbornes on, one of them often. Yeah, he had his recurring guests for sure. I mean, Ozzy at one point in time was a cultural phenomenon for letting people in his home. I can't remember if we had celebrities doing reality television like that, where they weren't failed, they weren't on their way out. It was just like this is a guy that's relatively well off, and we're gonna see what his rock star life is like. And it was dogs shitting on the floor and him kind of running around drunk, Sharon. The Osbournes was a really influential show, really. Um, not just with the celebrity stuff and um, the idea of beating their house, like which later became a whole show on its own with cribs. Uh, they um they're like the precursor to the Kardashians and all that other stuff that came afterwards. You do talk about that in your book, yep, yeah, yep. Um, I think I agree with that, and I don't know if Howard Stern wants to do that. I think Howard Stern gets to live in a certain world of Kayfabe where he doesn't have to let people in, and he's one of the last people to do that, you know, as we're watching, you and I were talking a little bit about Terry Balaya, Hulk Hogan. As we're watching these people die, these people that we're seeing pass on didn't have big social media presences as far as you have to see every aspect of their life. Now, Hogan had a reality show, A la Ozzie, after Ozzie, but it was called the Hogan's. It's not their name, you know, but it was called the Hogan's. And you didn't, did you get an insight into their life? You know, again, according to Brooke, who did an interview recently, no, not really. Because how the Hogan's made it seem like their life was good. Yeah, and she was like, no, our life was horrible. Yeah, his wife fucking hated him. So it's all Kayfabe in a certain aspect. And Howard Stern, I feel like if he goes, no, I'm going to bow out. I would understand because this media landscape, again, is very different. You have to be interactive in a way stars 20 years ago did not have to be. And he's the last of that crew of people that is like, you don't know shit about me. You don't know where I live. You don't know if I'm dating anybody or married. You don't know shit. He would not want to be physically around people either. He's like a giant germaphobe. I mean, imagine what his life has been like for the last 50 years. He's been in radio for at least the last 40. Yeah. Yeah, it was, God, he had some of his first stations like in upstate New York. That was, I mean, that was before. Yeah, that was before I was alive. So that's what I'm saying. It's like, I don't think these people want to get into a world that's a little more interactive where people aren't going to want to listen to you be a character. That's what, like, with the porn stuff. They're characters. And sometimes they even use their real names, but they're, they're not, you know, come on. They know what the deal is. Yeah. It's a dick buffet. Every day is a dick buffet. That's your next book. Every day's a dick buffet. There's a, I was just thinking, there's a Gabby's Dollhouse show song that goes every day is a sprinkle party. When you, and I had that in my head with dick buffet. Every day is a dick buffet now. That's what happens when you have these conversations and you watch a lot of children's programming during the day to keep. Well, don't sing that one when you're dropping your kid off at the D Care Center because then you're going to get a very uncomfortable note. But I think your kid's too small to talk back, right? No, she's ready. Got a lot of attitude and fire. Oh, shit. She's not even three yet. She talks a lot. Don't sing the dick buffet song. Yeah, no, I can't. I know it's going to. Slip out that didn't sound that good. You know what I mean? Everything I said sounded horrible. Uh, when you think of the passing, I want to stay with the Hogan thing for a minute. With the Hogan thing, there was a lot of people kind of happy he died, and a lot of these social media posts about him going to hell and finding out there's black people there, which is really funny because it's not like he didn't have a black wrestling partner for a lot of his career. But anyway, um, do you think people don't separate the man from the wrestling persona? It's uh, it's hard to separate them, and part of that is um like the way Hogan has presented himself for so many years. I mean, he was the Hulkster even when he wasn't out of the ring, when he even when he was out of the ring so often. Um, he argued in court, even that when he was on Stern's show, this is relevant to Stern, um, that when he was talking about this, because he's in a lawsuit with Gawker Media because they published the sex tape of Hogan doing the wife of uh Bubba, the love sponge. And um, they the Gawker lawyer says, like, well, you talk about your sex life publicly for millions of people on the Howard Stern show. Why, why is this a private matter now? And he says, Well, I that's not my sex life, that's Hulk Hogan's. Hulk Hogan has a 10-inch penis. When I said I had a 10-inch piece, I was talking about Hulk Hogan's piece. That's not that's not my piece, that's not Terry Balea. So, like, he wanted to present himself as Hulk Hogan, kind of all the time when he was in the public eye. He's not, he's not wrestling when he's on Howard Stern's show, and he's probably not even with WWE at that point, and yet, he's, you know, saying, Well, I was Hulk Hogan when I was there, I'm I'm only Terry Balea when I'm like in my house, basically. That's where it's different. That's when you're invading my privacy. When I'm outside, I'm Hogan. And if that's the case, if he really feels that way, how could you know the real Terry Balea? Because even if they're filming a reality TV show, it's fucking called Hogan Knows Best. That's why I said that you know, I watched a thing about what's the black wrestler's name? New Jack. You remember New Jack from ECW? New Jack was crazy. New Jack was crazy, you know, stabbed a man. New Jack was crazy, and he passed on. He died, I think, maybe two years ago or last year. And Jim Cornett said, because he discovered New Jack, he says this thing about him. He goes, I don't know where the wrestler ended and the real guy began. And I don't think I ever really wanted to know. And I think that's how a lot of those people live their lives. Alex Jones is another person that during his court transcripts that came out during his divorce hearings, where he was like, Alex Jones is a character that I play for the radio. This isn't real. I understand that. And do these guys get lost in the sauce of even their own make-believe personas at some point? And don't really David Lee Roth, his biographer, was on this show and said, one-on-one in a room with David Lee Roth, he's a decent guy and he's really interesting. Once one more person walks into the room, then it's Diamond Dave. Do you think that these people are like that as well? Yeah, there's a, it's when your whole professional life is dependent on that thing, I think it'd be hard to separate after a while. And especially if that character is based on some of your real attributes. Like, you know, they say in wrestling, the best characters are like the ones that are yourself turned up to 11. So if there's a, if there's some of Terry Balea in the Hulkster, after a while, it would become tough when you've been openly embracing that Hulk identity for so long. It also provides a convenient excuse, though, to dump all your nasty shit and say, well, I got lost in the being the Hulkster. Yeah. I got lost in the fame and the money and the, you know, the pressure. I do think you get lost in who you really are because you're always on. You know, I don't know what it's like to always be on because I live, A, I'm not famous. And B, I live somewhere where no one is watching this English-speaking show. So, you know, I'm not going to be, you know, hopping around downtown Rosarito. Hey, Huston. You know, it's never, it's never going to happen. Yeah. But. You know, these guys also get just torched if someone meets them and they're not on. I'm interviewing Dave Ellivson from formerly of the band Megadeth, my favorite band. And I met him randomly, I think, the Beverly Center when I was on tour about 10 years ago. And I totally fanboyed. I walked to him. I was like, excuse me, Mr. Ellison. I don't want to bother. I think we're at the same food court. I don't want to bother you, but I'm a big fan. And he was really nice. Maybe it's the Midwestern thing in him. He was like, oh, geez, what are you doing here? Oh, you're in a band? Oh, no. What's the name? Like, just super nice, right? Like, I wanted to walk away. And he was being super nice. And I kind of ran away from him because I was also terrible. I can't believe I talked to Dave Ellison. But that's my only interaction with that guy. I could have walked away. He was like, another N-word comes up to me one more time. Can you get security? Like, I don't know what he said after that. You know, I don't know if he's a piece of shit to his family. You can ask him if you're going to have him on. Oh, did he call me an N-word afterwards? Yeah. Did you call me an N-word afterwards? We got it for you, Nugget. There it is. You guys are waiting for that. And Hulk Hogan is not a little man. I met him. He definitely wasn't six foot seven because he can't stand up straight when I met him. But he's a big dude. He's still muscular or was. And you know who the fuck he is. Even if he doesn't have that dumb half-bald wig on, you know who the fuck Terry Paleo Cogan is. So you kind of have to always, you go to the, get your car washed. You got to be on. Pick up your dry cleaning. You got to, you got to be decent because there's people that are pieces. They're dicks. You know football. What's the linebacker that played for the Raiders that spit in JJ Stokes' face? Bill Romanowski. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. He was a mean guy. He was not. No one liked. He lived down the street from me when I lived in Oakland. I used to live in the Montclair district of Oakland. I was a homeowner. And no one liked Bill Romanowski. Not one person that had to deal with him in the community. They were like, oh, hated him. Good linebacker, though. Yeah. Linebacker doesn't need to be liked by anyone. Apparently. He was just like, nobody dug that dude. So I do question the fact. Like, do you, do you feel you have to always be on? And who really suffers to me is like the person's family. You know? Yeah. Wrestlers from that era were pretty dysfunctional. Like, my God. More so than I think the wrestlers now are. They did so many dates. I mean, you talk about always being on. They would do like, he'd do like 150 shows a year, probably, at the peak of Hulkamania. They're doing tons of house shows in addition to like every TV taping. You know, now like, does Roman Reigns even wrestle 12 matches a year? You know what I mean? Like, he has, he has other appearances too, where even if he's not wrestling, but um, it's a, it's a lot different now and how demanding they are physically and on the road. Those guys wouldn't see their families for like three months in the 90s and 80s. I don't think that happened as much now. I think they were gnarly dudes. Look, do I want to did I want to hang out with Hulk Hogan? No, he seemed like kind of a sad man when I met him, and I didn't really care to be honest with you. Um, he was Stardust at the time, Dustin Rhodes. That motherfucker seems like a fun guy, Goldust, right? Goldust, yeah, yeah, yeah, that dude is fun. Goldust, I love that character. What a what a strange like he did all that, like weird shit with like his like little like homo erotic gesture. I thought he was funny. He was hella, he was a wild boy. That's that guy seems like some fun to hang around with. Um, Hogan, not so much, uh, but you know, again, I look at a guy like Howard Stern, taking this back to Howard Stern, and not just the media landscape changing, but the way you have to interact with people has changed so much. Um, the growth that Sirius was able to achieve under Stern is kind of astronomical when you hear. Those numbers, what is like a 500% increase during his time with Sirius as far as the listener base? Yeah, Sirius, though, they had a big growth at one point because they're coming from a small base, but they've been plateaued for a while now. I don't know what their endgame is going to be or what they're going to do. And then, even like they, you know, Sirius and XM used to be different companies, too. They used to be different services. Yeah. There's a merger. Yeah. Yeah. There's a merger. And it's still a company with some serious structural issues. And that what they were paying Stern, like, it was reported like $100 million a year. I don't think they could pay him anything close to that on a new contract. Like that. That's just unsustainable at this point because they're not adding listeners like they had been. I think they've, I don't know what they have, probably like 30, 30-some million subscribers. It just kind of stayed there. Yeah. So where does he go? That's what I'm saying. Like, I think you just kind of go to pasture. Maybe you do things when you want to do them. If you're really that bored, you can put together a radio thing or a podcast TV thing if you give a shit. But maybe, you know what? I think in closing, we've been talking about an hour. Ozzy Osborne, someone else you're very familiar with, had the greatest farewell and the only farewell show I can think of. Can you think of anyone else in any entertainment art form that got to say goodbye like that? No, because usually when they say goodbye, they come back. You know, how many farewell tours do so many bands have? Or they're dead. Like the concert for George Harrison was great, but he's dead when they have it. Yeah. So does Stern have his goodbye? You know, again, I'm a big Megadeth fan, and their upcoming record, they just said it's going to be our last 40 years. We're calling it quits. Is it how true is it? I don't know, but these aren't spring chickens anymore. There's only one original member. I couldn't name one person in the band now outside of Dave Mustaine. And they're going to hang it up. And I'm sure they're going to have pack shows. They're going to charge double now for the meet and greet because it's going to be the last time you can meet and greet them. Merchandise is going to be the last time you buy it. So that's going to go up in price. And there's going to be a massive resale market for it that they'll probably flood with backstock that no one knows is backstock. So it'll be a possible money-making venture for at least a year and a half to three years, depending on how you stretch it out. Is this what Howard Stern does? Well, he's already teasing that, like, he's using all this rumors and contract negotiation as promo for his show. He, like, they put out some statement about like he's going to tell all on September 2nd. September 2nd, I saw that. And that's just going to drive up listenership. I don't know if he's actually going to share anything substantial. He could just kind of keep teasing it like that for another month. To the end of the year, and then go, all right, they didn't re-sign me. I'm out. Yep. But isn't there something to be said though about now having the big send-off goodbye? Because we saw Ozzie do it and it was kind of beautiful. I don't know if you watched any of the Ozzie stuff. I saw, um, I saw a few clips online. Like, I saw Jack Black playing, and um, I saw another one, I just saw like two songs. I think you saw Steven Tyler with uh, do the Led Zeppelin songs. I didn't see that. You should watch that. Okay, I have it. I'll have to find it and send it to you because it's it's kind of badass. It's pretty good. I didn't know Steven Tyler could still because he's 70-something himself. Yeah, he's new spring chicken, and Aerosmith had to call it a day because of Steven Tyler. I do feel like Stern's probably still negotiating, though. I don't know, like, all this stuff that's in the press feels like it's all being used as part of his whatever you want to call it, farewell. Like, he's still putting the pieces together on this. Is there a next Howard Stern in today's media, or has that shock jock format been permanently absorbed into mainstream entertainment? I think it's just, yeah, it's, I think, I think that format's fully absorbed. Um, if you had a new Stern, someone like that right now, I just don't think they would stand out amid the noise. It's hard, it's hard to stand out now. You know, Rogan is probably the most popular, but he's doing something different than Stern for sure. Very different. Very different. I would say Rogan is closer to Charlie Rose than he is to Howard Stern. Yeah, yeah. I mean, because Charlie Rose, that makes sense because he has someone on to just sit there and talk for 90 minutes, right? Yeah, and with the black backdrop, you know, you don't need anything. It's just you and I having a conversation for a couple hours or an hour. Howard Stern is a circus. It'd be weird to run a podcast like the way his show was. We try. Nice. We try. I mean, you've only been on here with just me, but there's a couple other people who are not as wacky, but we definitely fall down some wacky rabbit holes. We're never going to, I shouldn't say never. We haven't had any porn people on here yet. Maybe that's why. And I'm not saying we would never do it, but the Stern turn hasn't happened for this show yet, but we definitely love having fun. But I think one of the things that you can do when you're Howard Stern is whatever you want. And that's what keeps the job interesting. If I had to talk about the same thing every week, I would have stopped this a long time ago. I get to talk to you. I get to talk to musicians. I get to talk to movie producers of films that I like. And then I get to talk about other things that are more pressing and quote-unquote important. But I think Howard Stern has to do that. Yeah, he'd have, you know, he has people on who he likes, you know, C-list celebrities who he's harassing. But then like he would have on like, you know, ACDC or Ozzy just because he likes them. Yeah. Legitimately likes them. Yeah. Yeah. Like he had a lot of entertainers who like, it's just like, well, that's just like the things Stern likes and he just wants to talk to those people. He did a ton of that. That's probably fun. Yeah. And I think that's what makes his show memorable for people is that you know you're watching a guy fan out in front of you know someone they really dig maybe saying the things that you wish you could have said he's speaking for you maybe in those moments um someone said in the comments that howard stern was was doing kind of a play-by-play during 9-11 when that happened when he was at work and he was like i did so i was like wow that's pretty interesting i didn't know that i would love to hear the the broadcast of that because that would be so interesting to be listening to stern you know just making his dick and fart jokes and then like pivot as real hard-hitting you know cataclysmic news happens that that's really shit he probably had more people listening to him in new york than any other host at that moment yeah like a lot of people are probably listening to him so i get i get the love of a person like that they're in your car in your house at your job every day for 30 years i get it and then they're gonna go away and and it's not just him again it's his cast of characters jokingly people were saying what's gonna happen to robin and i for me that's why robin and howard stern were on the the thumbnail for this show because as much as people kind of shit on that woman for being kind of his token, I don't think she ever was a shield for him. I don't know if you disagree i they seem like they like each other. Yeah. Like they're, I mean, if it was just merely a shield, she's been doing that for a long time. I don't know. Maybe it's part of the con that I've bought into, but I get the sense that they're co-workers who just like hanging out and doing this thing together. And she's like a good, like, you know, he's the kind of crazy, crazy, wacky one, and she's like the voice of reason. Yeah, the straight man. I'd say the straight man, but she's a woman, but she's like the voice of reason, the one who plays it straight, who is calm and reasonable there. I think they play off each other extremely well. Yeah. I think he can't stay on air for a gajillion years without that woman. I don't know if anyone agrees with me, but he gets all the credit. But you need her. You need that voice of reason amongst the chaos. You can't do chaos forever. If that was the case, then there's people way crazier than Howard Stern. We're having a man cow. Well, and he can't just like do a monologue. Like a lot of their show was just them having conversation as shit. Would happen. Yeah. Kushluk says, The Watson to Sherlock Holmes. I think so. And I was thinking like Ed McMahon for like that's a really good analogy. Really old people. I wouldn't have used that with you because I would assume you didn't know Ed McMahon like that. Yeah, Ed McMahon got to do his own thing, though, with Star Search. And I don't know if Robin ever been able to, I don't know if she can do what Ed McMahon did with Star Search, where for the time that that was a show, that was Ed McMahon's thing. Yeah. It was way more low budget than the tonight show. But that's Ed McMahon's thing. What does Robin have if Howard Stern is over? Can she hold a show down on her own? Because if so, and this is where it's sad to me, it would be extremely different. It would be probably closer to some MSNBC stuff. Well, it'd be like how the Steve Wilco show is way different than the Springer show. It spawns from Jerry Springer, but like the Wilco show is like way more serious and like not about fighting and sex like the Springer show. But yeah, I someone says Man Cow was a douche. Do you remember Man Cow? No, I, God, you're bringing up a lot of things that I should know but he was around the same time as Howard Stern. He did a big stunt where I don't know if you remember Bill Clinton famously had a like a hundred dollar haircut or something like that. And then Man Cow got his haircut, I think, on the Bay Bridge or Golden Gate Bridge during rush hour and caused a big kerfuffle. Just kind of of that shock jock era. Like, what wild, wacky thing can I say? Again, I don't think these people exist in just wild, wacky, crazy shit. You have to put something together, you have to put a cast of people around you that works. And the Stern universe has a cast of characters around it that works very well. Yeah, wasn't Artie Lang part of that? Yep. Yeah, there's been other. So he's had some people who have used that to leverage into other show business stuff. But Robin is his Scotty Pippin. Yep. And Scotty didn't win a championship without Jordan. What does Robin do without Howard? Probably retires to her own mansion in the Hampshire. Yeah, her own compound. I'm sure she's been paid handsomely for a long time. Is this the end of an era? I'll leave you with this last question. And thank you again, Ross, for taking the time to talk with me. If you guys haven't picked it up yet, please pick up Ross's book, 1999, The Year of Low Culture. I think it's a, you know, if I say important book, you guys are talking shit to me about why it's not. But I think if you want to examine a moment and look at where we are now, start with that book. Does the end of Stern show mean the end of an era or just simply he's passing a torch? Oh, it's the end of the shock jock era if it hasn't already ended because he's already pivoted his show. And I think it's the end of anyone from Sirius Satellite Radio getting that kind of contract. Like, that's crazy money that he got. And, you know, he, so he was on CBS radio back in the day. And, you know, now he's on Sirius. His things have been exclusively distributed by one company, his radio shows. That's so different than now. Like, like, like we talked about it earlier, Spotify and some of these other platforms, they will do like an exclusive deal. It usually doesn't work out or last that well. And then it goes to non-exclusive. Every podcast is like all over the, like all over the place. Like, how many fucking platforms is this show on? You know? Yeah. I don't know. I don't, I can't think of anyone that's going to do what like Stern does to get that huge and to have it in one place. Because to do, to like, if the next person that's going to be the big fucking talk person, it's going to be on YouTube and Apple and Spotify and Pandora and on and on and on. He just did such a different thing with exclusive broadcasting rights going to one company. I think that era is done. I agree. I agree. I think the man, the landscape is done. I think the era is done. I do think we're going to get a massive. Howard Stern Apalooza concert in New York. That's my prediction. That's what that's the September 2nd announcement is going to be. This big, maybe even multiple-day event. Stern Apalooza. That's his pivot. He needs to have an insane clown posse on there. He's going to have all that goofy shit on there. Insane clown posse, battling with Eminem in a wrestling ring, a big mud wrestling. He's going to bring back all this shit that no one knows what it is, like mud wrestling. What's mud wrestling? Oh my God, mud wrestling or the KY Jelly wrestling. Yeah, like that kind of stuff. There's going to be a weird dildo competition, a goon-a-thon, like you name it. It's going to happen at the Stern Fest. So that's my prediction. Hopefully, the dildo competition isn't sponsored by the same crypto company that's throwing dildos at WNBA games. What is that about? Isn't that a crazy guerrilla marketing tactic? It's just gorilla marketing. Like, ha ha ha. But, like, what the, like, who sees the dildo at the basketball game and is like, oh, yeah, put my money in crypto. But I got to go buy that crypto. We got it. Crypto. Dildo crypto. We got it. Dildo coin. They should have put at least like a logo on it or something. I didn't know that's what it was. It was some dumbass crypto shit. That's even worse than it being some sexist shit. Yeah, when it was the sexist shit, I giggled. Even though it's horrible, I was like, kind of funny seeing a dildo. I mean, I, and you know, I would love to see a dildo at an NBA game, too. You know. So, uh, like equal opportunity. Yeah, equal opportunity. I want to see like LeBron, you know, and fucking Damian. Well, Damian Lillard's hurt, but uh, I would love to see Steph Curry draining threes with the dildo right at his feet. That'd be great. Um, that is horrible. Oh, my God. But then when you hear it's like a crypto marketing thing, you're just like, oh, that's, I didn't want to know what it was, and now you've told me Santa Claus isn't real. And fuck Christmas. That's how I look at it. Just motherfuck Christmas now. Jesus. I want to have you back on, of course. But I know you have to go. If your dog walks out one more time, you might get bit in the testicles. Yeah, he's pretty mad at me, man. Well, thank you for hanging out with us, Ross, and have a very good rest of your evening. Catch you later. Peace, brother. I like Ross. I like Ross. I think you guys should read Ross's book. It's a really in-depth look. Kind of an important part of time, point in time. You want to, how do we get Donald Trump? How do we get Joe? How? How? How? Read his book. Read his book. It's not a direct roadmap, but oof, he definitely lays out the evidence. So get his book. And what is he talking about? Draymond slander. Hey, no, Draymond slander will be tolerated in this chat. Oh my God, you guys are talking about Draymond. Okay. I'll be back tomorrow morning with Pascal and M. Toussaint, where we'll be talking about cultural appropriation and breakdancing. I'm trying to reel you in slowly for what the show is going to be about. But on that note, we are out.
