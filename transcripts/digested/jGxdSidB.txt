[00:00] If you feel a little stuck in life, I
[00:01] found a way to use AI to maybe get out
[00:03] of that. It's by telling it what you
[00:05] already love and letting it analyze the
[00:06] patterns behind that and finding new
[00:08] things that you would potentially love.
[00:10] Here's the problem for you. What are the
[00:11] components of some of my favorite
[00:13] activities, hobbies that I love so much?
[00:16] And can I find those components in other
[00:18] areas of life? But then I proceeded to
[00:20] give it some activities that I love and
[00:22] some of the reasoning behind it that I
[00:24] see there. And then I ran this through
[00:26] GPT5, which was a good answer. It told
[00:28] me, hey, with kite surfing, these are
[00:30] the components. There's technical
[00:31] mastery, there's freedom, there's
[00:33] adrenaline and risk, self-reliance, and
[00:35] more. And then it gives me
[00:36] recommendations of other activities
[00:38] where I could find this. Like similarly
[00:39] to kite surfing, I could try backcountry
[00:42] snowboarding, which is actually my
[00:44] second favorite sport on Earth next to
[00:46] kite surfing. So, great recommendation
[00:47] there. FPV drone flying, which I do too.
[00:50] And then rock climbing and sailing are
[00:51] the ones that I'll keep for the later
[00:52] years of my life. And there you go.
[00:54] That's one way for AI to enhance your
[00:56] actual life rather than limiting
