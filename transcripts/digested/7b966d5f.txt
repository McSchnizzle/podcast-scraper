Now, on to something that I'm very excited about. A little bit of a pre-birthday present to myself. We get to interview, talk with David Elliffson. Over 40 years ago, David Ellivson left small town, Minnesota for Los Angeles to stake his claim in the burgeoning heavy metal scene. A fateful meeting with Dave Mustaine led to the formation of Megadeth, where Ellison became one of the key architects of Thrash Metal. Beyond his legendary run with Megadeth, Ellivson has showcased his bass mastery with bands like Soulfly, Ministry, Dieth, and the supergroup Metal Allegiance. Since branching out on his own, he's launched a record label, a film production company, and now returns with a new heavy metal project, Ellison Soto. Their debut is a riff-packed, melodic, and progressive record, equal parts, fist-pumping anthems, and intricate passages. Today, we'll talk to David about his journey from Small Town Hopeful to Heavy Metal Hero and deep dive into the exciting new chapter that is the Elliffson Soto record. Please welcome, coming all the way live from a secret metal bunker somewhere in America, David Elvison. Thank you. Thank you for joining me. We were having such an interesting conversation off there, and you don't have a lot of time. So I'm like, okay, we got to hurry up and get everything in. I got to listen to the record. I really like it. I actually wrote now. Notes as I listen to it for certain songs I have questions about. Okay. Elephants and Soto record, I'm sure. Yes, the Elephants record. Okay, good. Yeah. Unbreakable feels like both a celebration of classic heavy metal and a push into new territory. What was the original vision you and Jeff Soto had when forming the project? You know, when we started it, so it's funny, there's a third wheel in here, Andy Martin Jelly, our guitar player. He's really the kind of the trifecta, the trilogy here. It should be really probably Ellis and Soto, Martin Jelly, because Andy and I write stuff all the time. He's the musical director of most of the stuff that I do when I'm in Europe, when I'm touring my bass warrior stuff. We did some bass story stuff together. So Andy and I really have a good musical synergy. And so all of the Elephants and Soto stuff starts with me and Andy writing the music first. And usually it starts when we're up in London, up in the Wembley area at Rogue Recorders. And Andy and I get together. We just start throwing riffs at each other and songs happen. Usually, I'm not even kidding, within a couple of days, we have the better part of an album written and good to go. And, you know, then from there, our initial, our first record vacation in the underworld that we wrote in 2021 during the pandemic, you know, we not only had those songs, the better part of an album, but I had one other track in particular that ended up going on a record called Writing in the Wall. And that is a song that I'd written and been kicking around for a while. And I couldn't find the right singer on it. I wrote all of it, but my voice, I could demo it, but my voice wasn't right for the final, you know. And so Andy really encouraged me to call Jeff, which I did. And I just called Jeff. I said, hey, can I just flip you a couple of bucks to you know throw a vocal down? And because I don't like to call in favors with, you know, friends that make a living, you know, doing this. So, um, I mean, literally, within I don't know, a half hour, hour at the most, he came sent the whole track back with harmonies and all this beautiful stuff. It's like Queen, you know, I'm like, holy hell, man. Um, you're definitely the guy I want to write some more songs with. So, um, I started sending a couple more things that Andy and I had written over, had written over to Jeff. And I mean, same thing, they just kept coming back. I completed you know, songs and going, My gosh, this guy, not only is he the voice that I love and the cool guy that I really like, um, but he he just took the songs to where you wanted them to go, you know. Um, and my attitude is, is you know, you hire the best and you let the best go be the best. You know, I don't want to have to sit and tell a singer how to sing. I mean, you know, once in a while, maybe there's hey, let's try this on the chorus or whatever. But, you know, for the most part, you know, Jeff does this does on the vocal part what I do on the bass, what Andy does on the guitar. You know, we each get so I say there's sort of the three sides of the pyramid with us. And so when it came time to do album number two, Andy and I got together up in Wembley again in 2023. I think it was April 2023 or something. I was over in Poland. I'd been shooting some videos for my band Dieth over in Poland. And I was, so I was, you know, kind of in Europe at that time. And so I, we got together. Same thing, just a bunch of tunes fell out. And we didn't really know if we were going to do album number two, to be honest with you. Um, Jeff's busy. He's got Trans-Siberian Orchestra. He's got his own solo stuff that he does. So, it's sort of you know, so these kinds of things, the hardest thing is just to get a schedule, you know, to get everybody together. And um, so we had the material sitting there. Um, you know, last year, I think it was August of last year, um, Andy and I we played a show under David Ellison, under my name. Uh, it was a little open-air festival outside of Rome, and we were backstage and we were talking about it. I said, You know, I want to get some more new music into the set, you know. And, you know, Andy's like, one more time, hey, why don't you hit Jeff? And so, so the first thing I said, you know, just a cover would be a good way to start, you know, and I and I and I brought up, you know, the idea to do a queen song came up. I think probably Andy suggested it because we know Jeff is a huge Queen fan. And the song I love from Queen, it's the very first song I heard when my mom bought me the night at the opera cassette back when I was probably 12 years old. And so, you know, the very first song on that record is Death on Two Legs. Even though the big hit, of course, is Bohemian Rhapsody. To me, Death on Two Legs was just such a cool, heavy, in-your-face track, you know. So I hit Jeff. I literally, I think I was sitting at catering, and I said, Hey, dude, you want to do another one? He goes, Fuck yeah, I mean, so that's how it happens, you know. Um, you know, so and we look, we realize, you know, as much as it's a group, like me and Jeff are American. I have the band essentially are Italians. That's a bit limited to what we can work and how much we can do. I mean, we're going to do the Monsters Rock cruise in April. Yeah, how often do you guys get even get together? Is it just a couple times? Not much. Not much. I mean, you know, it's funny. Me and Andy are together a lot because we do bass warrior tour every March, some one-off things that we do. He and I get together, you know, and work on music and stuff and throw ideas at each other. But, and Jeff and I talk all the time. I see him every year when he comes through Phoenix here with Trans Siberian Orchestra. So, you know, we all see each other, but you know, to try to make a band work like that, it's, I guess it's one of the perks, I guess, of what happened from COVID. You know, everybody got creative about trying to work with other people because we were all home and no one is on tour. But also, you know, it's kind of the modern day, right? It's the modern age where, you know, we're not all renting a rehearsal room, walking in, jamming some tunes. You know what I mean? It's like now we kind of throw ideas back and forth over the internet. And if there's synergy, I look, I like to be in the room. I mean, I was going to ask you, what do you prefer as someone? Look, I told you off air that I lived in the room and played in the room and miss the one thing I miss. I now live in Mexico. The one thing I miss is being in a room. If I could be in a room with my buddies one last time, I don't have to be on the stage. I would just love to be in a room with those guys again, making noise. Do you feel the difference coming up with the riff, sending it to someone, they send it back? Does that take something away from you with that camaraderie and that bonding in the room? Well, here's what I find. If, you know, you can write some really good stuff without being in the room together. And, but the problem is when you go take it live out onto the stage, you haven't had any acid tests to see if it, does it really make your lip curl and go, fuck yeah, this is rad. You know, you don't get that, right? You know, you don't get that. When you're in the room together, you know, there's you have that litmus test right there, you know, that it's, and, you know, I think you hear more and more. I was just watching some Black Sabbath interview and I was reading Getty Lee's book. I mean, as I, you know, sort of, you know, read and hear these things from my own heroes of my own career, we all say the same thing. We wrote the song for us, right? If we didn't like it, God, there's no way we're going to let it out of the bandroom, right? It's like there's no, and I have another, I have another example of that. You know, my band F5 that I had, when Megadeth disbanded back in 2002, I wasn't looking to put anything together, but I happened to fall in with some guys here in Phoenix and we formed this group F5. And, you know, in the band room, we wrote some great stuff. I mean, within a month or so, we really, we wrote like an entire album and we couldn't wait to get together every couple of days to write more songs. And they were just falling out left and right. You know, we just had a great vibe. It's good synergy. In fact, they wanted to go play a gig at a club here. And I kind of chickened out because I was like, well, God, I haven't played a little club like that in years. And, you know, should I do that? I didn't know what to do. I'd been in Megadeth for 20 years. No, I regret it. I wish I would have done it. And, you know, a part of it was just. you know, it was just a new chapter. You know, I'd been in a, you know, we built our group from the bottom up to the top. And suddenly one day it's over. And, you know, now I'm starting my next journey. And I was under no delusions that, you know, F5 wasn't going to be an arena rock band like Megadeth became. You know, I was, you know, without, you know, these things take time to build. And I wish I would have done it because it would have been fun. But our band wrote a bunch of songs. Well, then a friend of mine came along and he worked at Clare Channel Radio. And this guy had golden ears, man. I mean, this guy could pick a hit, whether it was J-Lo or freaking Savage Guard, whoever it was, this guy had those ears and he would pick the songs that ended up on the radio from all formats of radio. And, you know, he heard us and he took us in the studio and we crafted a record with him, which is a drug for all seasons. And it came out of, we became out of that process a very different band. Now, I love that record. I think we made an incredible record. Did it translate to the stage as well? I would say maybe not. And for my fans who like a certain, you know, like what you and me do, you know, that Bay Area be in the room kind of thing that you and I grew up on, you know, that's what my fans want to hear. So that record didn't connect with them as well. And had we stayed the course of what we were originally doing and building it from this kind of grassroots thing, guys in a room, play a club, take it from there, it probably would have gotten a much better ground swell and would have and gotten its own little fan base just based on that authenticity that you, and that's a problem with the internet recording thing is you can remove authenticity. You know, you can make everything perfect. Yeah. And you can make it all glossy and competitive with what's out there, but you know, you can also remove surgically remove the heart of the music. And ultimately, that's what people like. You know, they don't like, oh, man, your bass drums are perfect or hey, your guitar tone's awesome. I mean, that's cool too. But certain people like that, right? That's a certain minority. I'm tired of hearing those records. I mean, to me, that was the 2000s. Every record that came out was had this certain production style to it. And, you know, now more than ever, I like to hear records that really have some fucking diesel fuel in the tank. You know, mic cabinets for this on this record. We did, so it's funny. I played the bass. You know, Apollo cut all the drums in the studio, you know, big room. These are not programmed drums. He rented a studio, cut the drums. So they're real drums. You know, that's a different sound too. All the mics bleeding into another to capture the sound of a kit, the overheads. You know, when you hear a cymbal fade and dissolve, you know, is a, that's a, that's a, you know, just an organic real sound, right? Andy's got a bunch of stuff at his house, at his home studio where he recorded guitars. He's got cabinets, amps. You know, there's a little bit of modeling stuff, but for the most part, it's, it's, it's speakers moving air, you know, and you can tell a lot of guys, even on live now on big stages, are, you know, they're doing the digital thing because it's easier, it's more effective. I get it. It's cost effective. It allows smaller bands just to be able to even tour it all. So I get it. But man, there's nothing like a freaking microphone on a speaker that's moving air and kicking your pan leg, man. And it's, you know, I went to see Lenny Kravitz back in March in Mannheim, Germany. And I got to, his tech took me up on stage. I got to see his rig. And it's all, you know, it's all freaking Gibsons and combo amps with microphones on it. You know what I mean? And you can hear it front of house. It was, it was pleasing to the ear. Like my ears didn't get fatigued through the whole show. And the other guitar player, I'm sure probably had a similar thing. But, you know, to me, when I hear digital live music, it hurts my ears. It's like, you know, digital is ones and zeros, right? That's what all digital, anything is, right? And, you know, to me, 20 hertz to 20K, 20,000 hertz, that's really hard to replicate as ones and zeros. I mean, stage quality feels different too when you're on stage and you can totally does. Totally does. To me, it feels like razors on my ears, you know. And, you know, look, as bass players, we've always gone direct. You know, you put a mic on a cabinet or you do a, you know, a DI, you know, direct out to the house. So we've always kind of done the direct thing. And that's not digital. That's just sort of direct off the bass. But, you know, with guitars and keyboards, of course, are what they are, but you know, guitars and stuff, there is a real science to, you know, getting a really true in the room sound. And if you're mixing in any digital stuff as well, you know, which helps for programming effects and things like that. But there really isn't an art to getting it right, I think, front of house. And obviously, the more money you have, the easier it is because you've got kind of an unlimited budget. But, you know, I can tell big groups or little groups when I hear it. It's like, yeah, that's definitely, you know, kind of a camper or a fractal or that's a, you know, a digital sound. Right. It's got the same tone. I remember, and again, my recording budget was nothing. And luckily, I lived in a place where we could be loud at all hours of the night. Right. And I remember one day we had ran into Billy Gould from Faith No More and he had saw us recording. And he was saying, you know, I always wanted to. Try recording drums in this hallway. So we waited for the studio to close like the regular hour. So it's probably like two in the morning. And we were like, What if we put the speaker cabs in the hallway? It's like having fun with that to me for me is the fun of recording. And I think it's a different kind of fun when you're doing it digitally or in the way that you guys had to do it, where you're sending stuff back and forth with each other. Because I feel like your bass sounded meaner on this record. I don't know if you're using distortion. No, I'll tell you what I used. We were in, we went to Rogue Recorders in Wembley, me and Andy and our engineer Alessio, who's super talented, great singer, great musician. He sang with Dragon Force for a while. And he is just a fantastic musician. And we had a Fender P bass, a five string, passive. It was blue. It looked kind of like the Steve Harris blue bass. And it was passive. And so I was kind of going, God, I don't know if this is going to record okay with that. You know, I find lots of times with a five string and fenders. I'm not always a fan of Fender five strings because I feel like the scale length isn't long enough. They get a little, they thud out a little bit. But man, this bass was magical. And so I love that model. We borrowed it from a friend. And so I literally within two days, I recorded all the bass. And it's funny because even though I, you know, co-wrote every song, sitting there and creating those bass lines was an entire, it was very intense, like musical intensity, very condensed thought life. You know, you go into that kind of a session, and I've done this before in Megadeth Records and other records I've played on. You know, you go in, man, you are going down into a deep dive. Like you've never been to before. Like something that stretches your soul, your ability to find things in your playing that you didn't even know were there, you know, to be frustrated, you know, to, you know, it's funny that I saw a really funny thing. I was in the studio the other day cutting a tractor in town, and the guy had on the refrigerator. He had, it's called the creative process. He goes, this is awesome. You know, number one, this is awesome. Number two, this is challenging. Number three, this is shit. Number four, I am shit. Number five, it's not that bad. Number six, this is awesome. Right? That is it. Isn't that it, right? Because you get to that place, you go, how come I can't fucking play this? It's like, this is, you know, you know, Andy will be like, no, the riff, there's a little change down here. And, you know, and it's at that moment, you get super resentful. Fuck you. You're a guitar player. Don't tell me how to play my part. But you have to play it because it's what it is, right? And, you know, we laugh about it. It's funny. We literally laugh and make jokes at each other. But, you know, maybe it's a riff he wrote or something I wrote, but through his hands. And I really am very thankful for Andy with Ellis and Soda stuff because, you know, he's younger than me and he's got a very feisty, fiery, powerful sound. His hands on the guitar are great. He's a boxer. So he's got, and he's Italian, you know, so he eats good and he drinks a lot of coffee. He likes to hit hard, you know. And, you know, so he, I'll send him stuff that I write. And by the time it goes to his interpretation and puts it down on a track, it's it's really come of age in a way that I really like. You know, it doesn't sound like all of us doing thrash metal from 1983 or something, you know, and and I and I like that because I don't want this stuff to sound like it's from that era. You know, even if I write something that is from that era, I want it to sound like it's 2025, you know. And how does that affect you, though, sometimes where you're trying to make new music? You, you, you're like, look, I did this when I was in my 20s, and now I'm not in my 20s, and I have different things that are influencing me in the music I want to make.

Do you feel that sometimes you're pigeonholed by your success in a way? You know, yeah, yeah. I mean, look, success could become golden handcuffs. For sure. They can hold you back. They can limit your ability to expand. And sometimes it's your audience that doesn't want you to change. You know, they remember in my case, Rust in Peace or something, and oh, it doesn't sound like that. It's like, it wasn't supposed to. And even Rust in Peace, Megadeth never wrote Rust in Peace again. We wrote that completely in a super dark, you know, heroin addicted, you know, drug-adled way, which is funny that, you know, you think about heroin and you think of like sleepy jazz music. And here we are writing speed metal, you know. But, you know, we were, we were, and it wasn't just the drugs, it was the whole lifestyle, everything that was transitioning in the band. You know, the success was growing. Our movement was getting bigger. MTV was embracing, you know, the headbanger's ball. So they're just everything that went around it. I can't say Rust in Peace was just about the drugs because it wasn't. But that was certainly our lifestyle for sure, you know. And then through it, getting cleaned up and coming out of that lifestyle. And, you know, you go into drugs, it ain't so painful. It feels okay, right? But when you're coming out of it, dude, it's painful. It's hard on your soul. It's hard on your body. It's hard on your relationships that have been around you. Naturally, some people are going to get cut out and they're going to have to be left out forever. Even if they weren't the ones that did anything wrong, sometimes they just get cut out, you know, and you're rebuilding, you're bringing new people in, in our case, positive, you know, people to help us get a vision for what was going to be our future. So, you know, when people hear Rust in Peace, like, you can't just go, oh, man, you guys wrote some songs. Can't you just do that again? Like, give us one more of those. It's like, no way. You can't, because, you know, I always say I got all these gold records up here on the wall. And I only have them because I do a podcast. If I didn't do a podcast, I wouldn't even have them up. I mean, in fact, for years, I didn't even have them up on the wall because honestly, there's not always good memories in them. There's a lot of really painful, hurtful memories in them. There's a lot of shitty things that happen during the making of those records during the tour cycles around those records. So, you know, I can look at them now, forest from the trees, because I'm not that guy anymore. You know, I've grown up from there, but it's not all good. You know, I'm lucky. Look, I'm lucky I have them. I'm glad we had the success that we had. But, you know, those gold records, that's like a purple heart, every one of those. Those things have got a story behind them, and the story isn't always super awesome. You know, no, I this podcast generally is like more of an academic podcast where most academics have their wall of books behind them. But I spent my years playing music, so I have a wall of posters behind me of places, some of them that don't exist. And most of them are from a band I was in with my ex who came home one day and she was gone. So I, I, like you, also have the fondest memories and can kind of look back. It's been almost 10 years. And, you know, I did some music that I'm extremely proud of. I played shows that I'm extremely proud of in various parts of the world. So I maybe have a similar outlook as yourself, where people may look at these images behind me differently than I look at them, but it's a different kind of introspection. Sometimes when you break up with your girlfriend like that, I remember I'd have to move to a new apartment. I was like, living in Hollywood. I gotta move. I just don't want I gotta get rid of my car. I don't want any association. Oh, no. Brother, brother. I stayed in it, you know. We and we lived in the studio together, and there was pictures of us on the wall. It is what it is, man. I know, no, exactly. You know, you build a life with someone, and that's what being in a band is: you're building a life together with these people. And, you know, managers are part of it, agents, there's, you know, guitar tech. There's all the, all, all the casting characters are part of the story, you know. So when one leaves or you fire them or whatever happens, um, or people just decide to move on, you know, there's a piece of you that kind of leaves with that, you know. And and, you know, so yeah, it's all it's all part of the story. Which, you know, getting back to the record, and I know time is fleeting for us right now, but getting back to the record, it feels like a refreshing record in the sense of you must be really in a good place because there's not to me a sense of needless anger. Um, there's the song Vengeance, which I think is one of the better songs on the album, which is heavy as all hell. It just comes in, and you feel that it's probably got some personal meanings, but maybe not the meanings people think it has. Um, overall, I think. Like I said in the introduction, it's a very fist-pumpy record, but it's also a very complex record. And to your Italian homies, I felt the goblin kind of keyboardy intro for the opening track, which I thought was pretty cool. No, I think you, I think exactly as you said. It's fresh. I'm not walking around in a state of bitterness. I mean, look, you know, if anyone would have a place to be bitter and upset about how some things went in my, you know, more recent years of my career and things like that, it would be me. But I also know that, you know, you either get bitter or you get better. You know, you can either take the things that happen and you can pick up the pieces and move on and write a new chapter, write a new book, if you will, or you just get stuck in the same old fucking chapters. And that's why, again, you know, I'll just use the Rust in Peace comparison we get from a lot of our fans. Again, that record really meant a lot to them. It, it, you know, people ask me my favorite record, Megadeth record, that probably isn't it for me, you know. I like P Cells, I like Count on Extinction, I like Cryptic Writings, I like a lot of other records, you know. But so as I move forward here, you know, now a couple of decades pass, you know, it's like, if I was just going back in there trying to grind out the same thing, you'd be like, dude, what is up with this guy? Does this guy not ever like, let it go, David? Like, growing up, wouldn't that be the critique, though? Like, I remember, I remember vividly when Rust in Peace came out, because that was about 89, 89 or something. 90, 90. Was it was a 90? And I remember there was a video for Holy Wars. And I remember thinking, Uh, damn, those dudes look kind of buff because I was a kid, right? And I thought the pointy guitars were cool. I have a pointy guitar behind me that someone made for me because I'm a fan of the band. Um, and it was such a departure because I first heard uh, I got to save my lunch money and I bought a CD at a place called The Warehouse. These record stores don't exist anymore. Of uh, Killing is my business. Um, and it terrified me. The cover scared me. I was like, This is what it sounds like in a madman's basement. And so, so you kind of grow with the band, but there's something about when you're a young, to me, this when you're a young fan, you hear the record that you're like, Yeah, this is the one. Um, and you go, I want another one of that. But as you get older, and maybe because I did music, to your point about not being the same guy, I don't think I want a 50-year-old man to sound like a 20-year-old man. No, I agree. And I mean, look, I think this Unbreakable album is a good example of you can write things that are still heavy. Yes, I mean, you know, that Claire Channel guy that I was telling you about that did the F5 record, you know, he had a really good adage that I've adapted and I've stayed with. He said, David, you guys write music that's heavy but melodic. Yes. And that, and I look at my entire career was like that. All the music that I've made, and even growing up, you know, and I grew up with Kiss and Styx and Foreigner and BTO and all this stuff. All those bands, they were the heaviest bands at the time, but they all had melody, they all had good singing, they all had good singable hooks to them. And that I think that just stayed with me. That was kind of my radio rock that I grew up with. So, I brought that over into my world. Um, and and so I think with, you know, with Unbreakable, um, and I think having you know the Italians, you know, Paulo and Andy, you know, and our even Walter, who's my touring guitar player for Bass Warrior, he played a solo on the record as well. Because I, you know, I want everybody to be a part of it if we can, right? Um, since we may end up all touring the singer, being on stage with it at some point, um, you know, they're younger than me, you know what I mean? So, so I, and I think that started with F5 and also playing with guys who are younger than me, grew up on my music, um, but don't sound like me. You know, they didn't, they didn't go form Megadeth 2.0, they went off and, you know, they also were inspired by Evan Sevenfold and Lincoln Park and, you know, the 90s and 2000s music. They're inspired by that as well. So to work with these guys, you know, has been a real blessing for me to not just go in and go, well, I'm, you know, I'm David Elison and it needs to be like this. I walk into things going, all right, what do we got? You know, let's, let's, let's make a sound together. And I think that makes me a member amongst members. It makes me one of the guys. When my leadership is required, I will certainly step up and lead or, you know, make some executive decisions on business when need be. But, you know, for the most part, creating the songs and the music and the stories, I like it to be our story. That's for us. And, you know, I've been, I've done a lot of groups and a lot of records and a lot of music in my time away from Megadeth, both from 2002 to 2010. And even while I was in Megadeth, I was making records and doing other stuff. And never anything to try to, as they say, trump the brand. You don't want to sort of go out and be bigger than the band. And I didn't. I was always very respectful about that, you know. But at the same time, I knew what the creative structure was inside of that group. And that helped me not try to sort of force my creativity into that dynamic because at times it was welcomed. Usually it wasn't, you know, so it's sort of like, well, don't, then just don't even frustrate that. Just let that exist as it is, right? The walls are, you know, the walls are set. That's what it is. So take these things and go elsewhere with it. And toward the, you know, my later days of Megadeth, there was a lot of downtime. I mean, we had months, almost a year. 2018 was almost, except for eight weeks of touring, we were off the road. 2019, we had three weeks in the studio and that was it. Nothing, you know. 2020, we got eight weeks in Europe with Five Finger and then COVID hit. COVID hit. You know, then 2021, we're still in COVID. And then, you know, I'm letting go from the group. So it's like, you know, there's about four years in there where there was just not a lot of activity, you know. And so, for me, I'm glad that I got well ahead of that and already had a creative life, a creative cycle that was already moving and in motion. So, it's not like you know, oh, I'm not in the van anymore, I got to start all over. It's no way I was way ahead of that, you know. And because I'd already been part of that in 2002 when the band broke up, I was like, Yeah, I'll never let that happen again, you know. So, you know, so for me, I think you know, I've been on this creative journey. Obviously, I'm most famous for megadest stuff just because the numbers were big, right? And the support, capital records, and everything. But, you know, I wanted to be able to step off of that platform and not have to go. I wanted to be able to make a lateral move and be able to just keep going now, you know. And I feel like that has happened and I feel very blessed that that has happened. And I'm way, way down the road now of my future from that, which I think is great. When you were in Soulfly, I was so excited. I was like, oh, I was like, Dave Elizabeth's in Soulfly. I want to make before you go, I want to make an argument for playing a small club in Arizona. I don't know where in Arizona you are, but I played, I feel like every small club from Bisbee to what's the city way up top by Sedona, like uh Flagstaff or Prescott, Prescott. Yeah, um, I remember once in the right when Jason Newstead left Metallicus, was this like 2002, 2003? Right, metal was you know kind of on a bit of a decline. And Exodus was playing this little bitty club in a city called Concord, California in the Bay Area. And me and a buddy going to the show, and it was a little more filled than usual, but it was at a bar, right? This is Exodus, Exodus at a bar, and Newstead had just left, but he lived in the Bay. We didn't know, unbeknownst to us, he had pulled up with Voivod, and he just shows up kind of randomly, talks to the Exodus guys about fitting in, and they play a set about 45 minutes. Nice. And to this day, it's one of the coolest shows I've ever seen. Maybe 100 people in this little bitty bar. And we got to watch Exodus Voivod, another Bay Area band called Chaos. It was so much fun. You know, and that's right with Kings of Thrash, we do that. You know, we play the early Megadeth stuff, not exclusively, but that's largely what the set list is. And it's funny because that music was, you know, written and performed by the group when we were a smaller club band, right? And we were never a tiny club band, but you know, it was in the clubs, right? So it's interesting when you take that music, and part of the reason we stopped playing it over the years is as we got into the bigger rooms, those songs just didn't sound as good. You know, killing, you know, Rattlehead does not sound good in a hockey arena. It just doesn't, you know, you know, you know, and so, you know, it's, you know, the conjuring, you know, when you're on MTV and you play the conjuring, like, you know, the girl podbeam, your message amplifies.

You know, so you just lose the mainstream audience. They don't connect with it, right? So that's why a lot of those tunes got phased out of the set list over the years. And, you know, so with Kings, you know, we went back to it specifically, very pointedly and very, you know, very intentionally to hone in on those days. You know, they're fun to play. Their songs are super fast and aggressive and fun. But it's like what you were just talking about. You know, you play it at the club with Voibod Nexus. You know, that's really, you know, that's where it's meant to be. So, and you're right. They're, you know, headbangers love that, man. You know, you know, it's, it's so much, you know, because I go out and I see shows. I see my friends. And, you know, it's like, it seems like half the time I'm always walking up to a stadium. I'm like, how did, how did, since COVID, you know, everybody now plays a stadium. It's like, I don't know how that happened, right? Because tickets are more expensive than ever. Everybody's playing in a freaking stadium now. And, you know, stadium shows are great when you're the performer. For everybody else, they suck. It's like the worst place to see a freaking concert. You know, it's terrible. It's, it's, and even arenas are like, eh, you know, it's okay. I guess, you know, arenas are kind of more manageable with production and stuff. But, you know, it's, you know, for concert goers, bigger is not always better. You know, and even that's me as a fan who I get to perform on all the different size stages and all the different rooms of the world. And I get it. You know, I can appreciate, you know, playing the whiskey and playing some little club in Texas and stuff where the fans are just, you know, they love it. And I think about myself, you know, when I'm at a show and if I'm standing there and there's 10,000 people there, you know, outside of, you know, there's a bigger production, so maybe it's a bigger presentation. You know, the reality of it is, it doesn't matter if there's 10,000 people or if there's 10 people there, we're all going to have the same experience, right? We're going to stand there and go, this is either fucking awesome or I don't like it. You know what I mean? It's not like, well, you know, if there was more people here, I'd like this a lot better. I've never once said that at a concert. I've often said, I wish there weren't so many freaking people here because this is a pain in the ass and it's sweaty and they're spilling beer on me and everybody's taller than me. And, you know, I'm afraid I'm going to get freaking stamped on, you know, and stomped on in the fucking pit or something. You know what I mean? So I've never once said, yeah, if there's more people here, I'll like the show better. So it's, you know, so it's interesting to, I'm glad I get, I personally put myself in those positions from the audience point of view to just get a, to get a feel of, okay, what is the audience really seeing when we're up there on that stage performing? Because it's, it's, uh, our genres, you know, Bay Area Thrash, let's just call it, we were the same. Like the guys in the audience could be on stage and the guys on stage could be in the audience. That was, that is, do you think the same thing, right? Do you think it was more interactive? Like, again, because I'm from the Bay and I've gotten to meet the dudes, right, that you came up with. They talk about also their friends that were like thrashers, like this got Toby Rage. Remember Toby Rage? I remember Toby Rage totally, man. Like when you hear these stories, it's different to me because I feel like I'm in the age of the doer and people don't want to appreciate anything because they want to either take that as content to talk about or do their own thing. And when I hear stories from when you guys were coming up and talk to those dudes, which I've done, I would rather do that for a living sometimes talk about those days. And then there's that book, Murder in the Front Row. I remember those guys were putting it on the show. Right over here. Yeah. Asking about these shows and having some guys go, oh, no, I was there that night and this happened this night and this, this is the night, blah, blah, blah happened. Or even the first time you guys came up to the Bay Area in Megadeth, people go, oh, dude, I was there and they played at the old Keystone, which turned into the blah, blah, blah, and Palo Alto. And, but people were, the scene consisted of people that. Wanted to rock out and have a good time as well, and not a whole bunch of doers. Well, look, I'll give you a good example. So, you know, Exodus, you know, rowdy, fun their shows could be hit and miss. They had an amazing show on that 80, New Year's 85, 86 at the Bill Graham Civic Center, you know, Metallic Exodus, Metal Church, and Megadeth, I think, was the bill. And they were the best band of the bill. They were amazing that night. They just crushed it. And then other times, you know, they were always great. They're always a powerful, fun band. But, you know, you have your great nights and your whatever nights, right? Well, I saw them overseas at the beginning of the summer back in June. And, you know, they now Rob Dukes is in the band. And I saw him here in Phoenix too at a club. And it just didn't have the same impact to me because it was just a dirtier, different room, you know, that it's, it's, uh, but I saw them overseas and man, they sounded so good. Like I told Gary, I said, it sounded very expensive, which is really good, you know what I mean? Especially for a thrash band to sound just fucking tits on, you know, right on the point, you know. And they did. They just sounded fucking great, man. And Sacred Rec was with them. They sounded great as well. And so, you know, it's really great when you see, you know, friends, like you just mentioned, you know, from the Bay Area from back in the day, back in the scene. It was rowdy, it was loose. To, you know, now in today's age, um, you know, this is the last hurrah. You know, I was, I was telling Bobby Blitz that when I played with Overkill last year in South America, I said, you know, this is the last hurrah. It could be only another year or two, it could be another 20 years. We don't know how long the last hurrah is, right? But I think kind of once you hit about, I don't know, 50-ish, certainly by the time you're 60, which a lot of us are now, this is it, man. You know, because you people get health issues, you know, things change. Shit, now we got AI doing all this stuff. It's like, you know, you just never know. We do everything we can to control our music internally, but you know, trends come and go, things happen, or you know, COVID shows up. Hell, AI, who knows, maybe every record in five years from now will be some AI thrash middle record. Who freaking knows, right? Um, did playing with Ozzy? Because you play, you got to play at the farewell show, right? I did, yeah, which was pretty awesome. I've gotten to see some most of the footage. Does that put a period at the end where most people don't? I couldn't think of one actor, I couldn't think of one musician that actually said goodbye on their terms, right? We've had, yeah, no, 100%. I think he did it the right way. They, really, it's they, because it's Ozzy and Black Sabbath, you know, they both bands ended right at the same time. But, you know, just speaking to Ozzy's life and career, you know, he, um, it's, you know, it seemed like, as you, we all saw, he really wanted to come back to just say goodbye and for all of us to say goodbye to him, you know, and you know, to put the whole thing back together again, the OGs of Black Sabbath, you know, not just for us to say goodbye to them, but you know, they want to say goodbye too, you know what I mean? So it's like to bring everybody back so that it really is a farewell. I thought that was very well done. I mean, it was perfect. It was just really flawless. And, you know, you know, to have these sort of, to have, you know, it's almost like you have the wake before the funeral. You had the celebration of life literally two weeks before he passed, you know. So what a, you know, what a, and we all knew the end was near. You know, it wasn't a secret. And, you know, but we didn't know, we didn't know all the condition of it, and it's not our business. It's a private thing, right? But so, but for at least for to have that moment where we could say goodbye and rally as a as a team, and it wasn't just metalheads. I mean, like Sammy Hagar, Stephen Tyler, Travis Barker, there were non-metal guys there performing, Ron Wood, you know. So it wasn't just metalheads, it was rockers of all generations, you know, Youngblood is the new guy. And so for all of us, you know, everybody to be invited to that, to be part of that, to put together the, you know, the retirement party, if you will, and the farewell, you know, I thought it was, it was. It was brilliant, you know, and you know, there was talk like, well, God, maybe some other people should be doing this, you know, like who, who, who still has original members in the bands and maybe for sure, you know, and hey, and in one way, Boston to New York is like Birmingham to London. I mean, I think a Bob Bonero Smith farewell would be amazing, you know. Um, and you know, I don't know if they're going to do it or not, but but you know, you're right, that there's one. Um, and there's there's a lot of people, and it and it's not just about you know, doing the farewell cash grab, it's about the fact that they gave the money to charity that made it even more important that it wasn't a cash grab. It was uh, it was, hey, we're gonna do this, we're asking everybody to show up and be part of it. Uh, what's good for one is good for all. It's not like one band got paid a ton of money and no one else did, it's like no one got paid. It was a free show that everybody pitched in their time and their effort to make it happen. And the money went to the charity. And I mean, it just was so well done on every level. And of course, there, these are the best people in the business, you know, that were there from the production staff to the managers to the organizers. So, it's you know, it you just you really just can't say enough good about how the event itself was. And then the fact that you know our dear beloved Ozzie, you know, passed a couple of weeks later. It's just it, that that really was the exclamation point, you know. And, and, um, you know, yeah, it does make you think it's like maybe we should do more of this more often, like the way they did it, you know. Yeah, I mean, you have to have a certain amount of foresight, maybe that gets it's hard to have when there's there's just obvious hubris when we're musicians, even if we're up in age, because we don't know. I can still do it, I can still carry a tune, you know, right? I can get help loading in and out, I can keep doing this, and then, you know, one day you can't. So it was a beautiful thing to watch. It's pretty awesome that you were a part of it. As I think I look at you as, and maybe you don't like this, this term, kind of royalty in rock music in general. You know, you've done it at a high level, at an influential level. And this current record, I think, is a celebration of that. Again, you know, you get to, you, you put the band together to some degree, right? You get to turn yourself up a little bit more in the mix, which is a good thing. So people can actually really feel and hear that bass tone. That I will say it again, feels a little angrier. There's something a little heavier, a little dirtier in this record. Maybe it's just me. But when is it coming out? No, I would agree. It actually just came out Friday, August 15th. Okay. And, you know, we only did a pre-order for the physical. We didn't do like your typical kind of digital pre-order and all that stuff. So we just did, because the physical packages are great with the albums, CDs, trading cards, patches, all the vinyl and everything, you know, to a true, you know, kind of metal package, right? Yeah. And you're right. I feel like it's some of my better bass playing of my entire career. You know, I feel like I really dug deep and worked hard, you know, creating these bass lines. And lyrically, same thing. Spent a lot of time, you know, with the lyric writing and the stories. And of course, when you've got someone like Jeff Scott Soto who can sing anything, that's great because he's just a blank canvas. You can throw anything at him. And what he comes back with is as good or better than you heard it in your head when you were writing it, you know. And I appreciate that. I don't want to just keep making music just because I'm bored and I don't have any else to do. It's like, if you're going to make a record and you're going to go through that process, because it's a long process. Like I said, this took a couple years really of from inception to street date. You know, what are you saying? Is there a story? Is there why? You know, I guess it's always the why this record. Why did you do this? What is what do you have something still to say? And I feel like with this one, we did. I mean, this is for sure one of my more favorite albums of my entire discography. And I'm glad that I was able to do it. You know, I'm 60 now and to make a record, I think, of this quality with the writing and the songs and the performances to make something of this quality at my age. I'm super happy and very proud of it for sure. Well, you should be. It is a very, very, very fun record. Like I said, there's some fist pumpy anthems. Some nice big hooks. And Jeff Soto's voice just soars over the top. I love it. Vengeance, again, I think it's probably the go-to track for me that I would play over and over. I don't know why it doesn't have more plays on the little thing than I was given to listen to it on SoundCloud. Because I was like, dude, it just comes in so fucking heavy and stays that way. It doesn't let up. It's unrelenting. And then you have a trick. Wait, I wrote it down. Track eight. is like a tribute to motorhead if i'm not mistaken it's like motorheady like a lemmy-esque track it felt real motorhead snakes and bastards is that the one yeah if that's the one i don't i can't remember the track listing in my head right now i think it is though yeah yeah you know just fun rowdy you know thinking about ace of spades kind of record you know what i mean something that that had that same fun rowdy kick ass it's not even punk rock it's just great rock and roll you know um i think that's that's where we were headed on that track well it's an album that i think flows well uh from seasoned professionals that tried to make a record that isn't random songs that can fit in a playlist but songs you have to hear in the order they were put in so that to me is important when listening to records i i don't know if you feel the same way it's like there was an era before vinyl and cassettes and then there's the cd era where things just change a little bit yeah i mean a scene and no i can totally agree with you i think that you know if you're just writing you can write tracks right and because you're just trying to you know everything's singles oriented spotify you know this kind of stuff versus when you, you know, I don't do that that. That's that's never how i've recorded. I've always made albums um that uh are a collection of material, it's a collection of stories. I always say it's like the family photo album, right? There's it's it's it's a collection of the photos, you know what I mean? And it tells there's a story. Here's the summer vacation. Oh, here's Christmas 1971, whatever. You know what I mean? It's like there should be a theme to it, you know. So that's why I think when songs, when we write to write, as Andy and I do, we write this batch of material all at one time. It sounds cohesive, as different as the songs can be, they are reflective of a period in time, you know, so that even if a little time goes by before we finish up the lyrics and get Jeff involved and have him sing the melodies, actually, at that point, we've had enough time away from it. We can almost look at it and go, okay, does it still hold up? Or were we just out of our minds grading a bunch of bullshit? You know, are these still good songs? And you go, God dang, that is a freaking good song. You know, I just hear like son of a bitch and snakes and bastards and vengeance and this stuff. And you hear it and you go, yeah, those are fucking great songs. And so, you know, then you move forward with the lyrics and you get Jeff involved. Now it gives a whole new fresh enthusiasm because the songs are getting completed. Of course, Jeff's got a big sound. He roars like a lion. You know, he's, he's, he brings, yeah, he brings a great punch. You know, so it's, it's, um, you know, so I think the way that we make these records, there's enough time that goes by that we don't sit there and pine and labor over them as much as we just come out of us. We will get away from it for a bit, and then we come back to it. And if we're still excited about it, which we are, then it's like, yeah, let's carry on. Let's finish this up. Let's let's make a real album out of this and let's put this out for people to hear. Well, you did. And is it going to be on Spotify? It's on Spotify now, or yeah, it's on all the digital platforms. Yeah, actually, on Friday is when all that stuff went up on the 15th of August and went up. So it's everywhere now. Well, thank you very much for taking the time to talk with me. I appreciate you giving me some extra minutes. I said, thank you again for connecting us. Of course. You guys, it's out now, Ellison Soto. I'm letting you know right now if you're going to be jerks and skip to what I think is the best track. And you can write comments in here and say, Jason, you're a liar. We think shout's the best track. I say vengeance track number seven. It's just so heavy. It's one of those things. I collect songs that are riffs I wish I wrote. And that's one of those things I'm like, okay, yeah, I'm mad because he did it before I did it. Okay. Sons of bitches. All right, buddy. Have a good one, Jason. Thank you very much. David Ellivson, thrash metal pioneer, music pioneer. Let's just be honest. Music pioneer. Decent. Human. Maybe before we say music pioneer, we should say decent human. He didn't have to give us all this time. I was given a little bit of time from his public. That's how these things work. And I was trying to take advantage of it. And he was nice enough to give us extra time. Wonderful. Let's give him another shot. Wonderful individual. So, on that note, I'll be back Tuesday. And I'm working on the K-Fabe documentary. Hopefully, we'll have it finished this weekend. And we are, where's the outro music?
