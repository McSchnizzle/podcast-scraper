[00:00] What's up everybody? How's it going? I
[00:02] am coming to you from beautiful Hawaii.
[00:04] And in this video, I want to answer the
[00:06] question that is on everybody's mind
[00:08] right now, which is, is it still worth
[00:10] it to learn to code in 2025, 2026, and
[00:15] the next few years? And obviously I'm
[00:17] asking this in the context of AI and you
[00:21] know the advent of AI how AI is getting
[00:23] better and better every day and is
[00:24] really threatening to completely
[00:27] eliminate the need for software
[00:29] engineers. Now as many of you know I
[00:31] learned to code back in late 2016 which
[00:34] I think was basically like right before
[00:36] the peak of the golden era of software
[00:39] engineering before you know the bubble
[00:41] of software engineering kind of burst.
[00:44] And as many of you know who've been
[00:45] following me on YouTube, I was one of
[00:47] the biggest proponents of, you know,
[00:49] learning to code. One of the most vocal
[00:50] proponents of learning to code. I made
[00:53] so many videos recommending that people
[00:55] go to coding boot camps to learn to
[00:56] code, uh, take computer science classes
[00:59] or computer science major in college
[01:02] because coding changed my life. I was
[01:04] able to land jobs at Google and
[01:06] Facebook. I was able to found my company
[01:08] Algo Expert which basically allowed me
[01:11] to retire in about seven years all
[01:14] thanks to coding. By the way, if you're
[01:15] a software engineer preparing for
[01:16] technical interviews, do check out my
[01:18] company algo expert. Go to aloexpert.io
[01:19] and use a promo codem for a discount on
[01:21] the platform. But so in the recent
[01:26] couple of years and especially the last
[01:28] six months or so, I have really been
[01:31] kind of like torn apart because I've
[01:33] asked myself or I have been asked by
[01:35] other people if you had let's say a high
[01:39] school student or a college student who
[01:41] was coming to you and ask you Clement
[01:43] I'm genuinely concerned about whether or
[01:46] not I should learn software engineering,
[01:47] whether or not I should learn coding
[01:50] because of AI. Like what if AI truly
[01:53] does replace software engineers in a few
[01:55] months or in a few years? You know,
[01:57] you've got like the anthropic CEO saying
[01:59] anthropic CEO saying that all software
[02:01] engineers are going to be replaced by AI
[02:03] within a few years or at least 70% of
[02:05] them and all that. Would it be better to
[02:09] learn a hard skill something like, you
[02:11] know, plumbing or carpenting? Those are
[02:13] the canonical examples that are going to
[02:15] be harder to replace by AI. And there
[02:19] have been times when I have started to
[02:21] lean towards like yes, it might actually
[02:24] be over for coders and software
[02:27] engineers. However, after having thought
[02:30] about it a lot, I actually still think
[02:32] that it's worth worth it to learn coding
[02:34] in 2025. And here's why. I think it
[02:38] really comes down to one reason. Maybe,
[02:41] you know, there's a second reason that
[02:42] I'll share at the end of the video, but
[02:44] the main reason for which I think that
[02:46] it is still worth it to learn coding in
[02:48] 2025 is that right now AI is is
[02:52] incredible, right? It allows virtually
[02:55] like everybody in the world to become
[02:57] more productive at so many different
[02:59] things. However, I think that software
[03:02] engineers are the by far the largest
[03:06] beneficiaries of AI.
[03:10] That is for multiple reasons, right? One
[03:12] of them is that like there's just so
[03:14] much um like money and effort that's
[03:16] being spent on AI for software
[03:19] engineers, right? For software
[03:20] engineering tooling, but also just like
[03:23] the the the the way that AI works lends
[03:26] itself so well to, you know, increasing
[03:29] the productivity of software engineers.
[03:31] And what that means is that software
[03:34] engineers benefit the most from AI right
[03:37] now. they benefit the most and are
[03:38] becoming the most productive in an
[03:41] economically useful way thanks to AI and
[03:45] that's really important right the
[03:46] economically useful way for example like
[03:49] let's take teachers right teachers also
[03:52] benefit from AI they can use AI to grade
[03:55] homework much faster or they can use AI
[03:57] to uh much more easily catch or know
[04:01] whether a student on their homework or
[04:04] on their tests with AI But that's going
[04:07] to improve their quality of life. That's
[04:09] going to make them, you know, do their
[04:10] jobs faster. But will it help them make
[04:14] more money? Will it help them get
[04:16] promoted faster? That's, you know, very
[04:18] debatable. At least when I think about
[04:19] it, you know, for five minutes. Perhaps
[04:21] I don't know the nuances of education
[04:23] and, you know, the job of a teacher.
[04:25] Overall, I would say that like the the
[04:27] use case for AI in teaching for a
[04:30] teacher to benefit the teacher is
[04:33] relatively limited when compared to
[04:35] software engineers. Software engineers
[04:37] can use AI to output so much more code
[04:42] to iterate so much faster on features
[04:44] and products to build companies or to
[04:47] build projects so much faster and so
[04:49] much more easily without needing nearly
[04:52] as many resources as they used to. And
[04:55] so software engineers are benefiting
[04:57] from AI way more. And so what that means
[04:59] is that like right now in 2025, 2026 and
[05:03] over the next let's say 5 or so years,
[05:05] there is this short window of time
[05:08] during which software engineers are not
[05:11] only still clearly employable like
[05:13] clearly companies are still hiring
[05:15] software engineers even though it might
[05:16] be less than in the past because of you
[05:18] know interest rates are much higher and
[05:20] soft and companies have kind of realized
[05:22] that they overhired in the past and they
[05:24] don't need as many software engineers
[05:26] but they're still employable.
[05:28] And right now as software engineers, we
[05:31] can benefit from AI the most. This is
[05:34] when you can really sign up your company
[05:36] and get promoted super fast. This is
[05:38] when you can vibe code your own, you
[05:41] know, startup or business that is going
[05:43] to retire you, you know, like Algo
[05:45] Expert did me in, you know, five or
[05:47] seven years. And so because of that,
[05:50] because of that, I actually would still
[05:52] recommend that someone who is thinking
[05:55] about learning to code do so right now
[05:57] in 2025. I genuinely think that it is
[06:00] still worth it. It is still worth it to
[06:02] know this skill and it is the skill that
[06:04] it will allow you to leverage AI and
[06:06] take advantage of it the most out of any
[06:09] other skill right now. That's my
[06:11] opinion. And the bonus sort of second
[06:14] reason for which I think it's still
[06:16] super worth it to learn to code is that
[06:18] at the end of the day, nobody can
[06:20] predict the future. Like if you had told
[06:23] the collective, you know, software
[06:25] engineering sphere back in 2021 that
[06:29] software engineers would be like
[06:30] terrified of being replaced by AI just a
[06:33] few years later. I think everybody would
[06:34] have been like super confused and
[06:36] wouldn't have believed you. So just as
[06:38] you know it was hard to predict what's
[06:41] happening right now back in 2021 I think
[06:43] it's very hard to predict what's going
[06:44] to happen in 2030 like who knows you
[06:47] know the the nuances and intricacies of
[06:50] how AI will actually replace software
[06:53] engineers in 2030 and beyond who knows
[06:55] whether or not you know hard skills like
[06:57] plumbing and carpenting will actually
[06:59] also be replaced by AI by then so
[07:02] because of that you know don't don't
[07:04] append a potentially very lucrative
[07:08] career right now just because you know
[07:11] in five years or in three years or in 10
[07:14] years AI may you know threaten your job
[07:18] may threaten the career so you know
[07:21] that's my take on it um thought about it
[07:24] a lot you know like I thought about it a
[07:27] lot you know would I recommend that a
[07:29] young person or someone think of a
[07:30] career change just abandon coding and
[07:34] the answer for me is no I think it is
[07:36] still worth it in 2025. Let me know what
