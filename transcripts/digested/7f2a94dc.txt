I am your host, Jason Miles, here for another episode of This Is Revolution podcast. While we usually have our sports show beyond the red zone on Wednesdays, the red zone will be back this Saturday when we actually discuss soccer and corruption. You asked for the football. You get the football. Don't forget after the show tonight, for all of the patrons and paid YouTube subscribers, we are going to have a bit of a group date. A fun-ass watch party tonight. We will enjoy the 1980s classic, Better Off Dead. So if you dig listener-supported programming we have here on TIR, think about becoming a patron for as little as $3 a month or $3 for the year. You can make sure TIR can continue this insane breakneck pace of shows. Now, let's get to the subject matter at hand while you guys are really here to discuss Milton Friedman neoliberalism. Milton Friedman's neoliberal logic did not remain confined to academic debates. It became a political project with global consequences. His ideas found their first laboratory under brutal conditions, Chile in the 1970s, where Friedman's Chicago boys advised Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship on how to rapidly privatize state industries, slash social programs, and open the economy to foreign capital. The violence of this experiment made clear that the So-called freedom of the market often required the suspension or outright destruction of political freedom. From there, the cancerous neoliberal project spread. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom championed Friedman's agenda of deregulation, tax cuts, union busting, privatization. Both leaders styled themselves as defenders of liberty and small government, but their policies shifted power dramatically toward capital, eroding working class security and weakening democratic institutions. By the 1990s, the logic of the free market had become bipartisan orthodoxy. Bill Clinton in the U.S. and Tony Blair in the U.K. embraced a third-way politics that fused neoliberal economics with centrist governance. Welfare reform, financial deregulation, and free trade agreements entrenched the very system Friedman had dreamed of, while cloaking it in the language of pragmatism and inevitability. Nearly 20 years after his death, Friedman's legacy is not a world of widespread freedom, but one defined by inequality, precarity, and the subordination of democracy to the dictates of global capital. Here to have this discussion with me is my homie, my dog, the man of the Mao Mau Hour, the co-host of this show, Pascal Robert. Peace and greetings in the chat, peace and greetings to the audience, peace and greetings, Jason Miles, on this wonderful Wednesday episode to excoriate the legacy of the ignoble Milton Friedman. And not just Milton Friedman, we're also going to dig into the Chicago school as well. And the person that put this show together, please welcome Alexander Herbert. That's Carl. This is the first time I've been on this show with you here. I'm happy you're here. I've heard so much about you. Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. You're always, I think the last time Alex came on, you disappeared because of their computer issues. Yeah, I've been having some computer glitches lately. Hopefully, it don't become a problem today because I want to stick into this piece of shit so badly. Well, before we even get started, I want to remind people that wherever you're watching or listening to the show, there's a link in the description to Alex's political economy class. Where if you find this interesting and would like to learn more, there's a link in the description where you can sign up. And Alex is actually teaching Milton Friedman and political economy currently with his political economy class. Now, Pascal, I know you have some questions or comments you want to kick off with. Yeah, Alex, can you please give us the historical background to Milton Friedman and why his particular form of economic analysis or the Chicago school became so salient, particularly after the period of the New Deal Civil Rights Coalition coming out of the 60s and the riot of Fordism that came out of the New Deal as well. And why his project was universally recognized as a means of torpedoing that coalition? That's a really great question, Pascal. That's one that puts, I think, a half of my political economy course on the table here to explain that. I will start by saying thanks to you two for having me on and thanks for letting me plug the political economy course. The second offering of this. So the first one was sort of the test. I think it went pretty well. Andrea can attest to that. She was a part of it. And now we're doing the second one. It's going to be even better, I think. But let's get down to business because there is a lot to cover to answer that question. And part of the reason, I mean, the Chicago school in my class, it's divided into five different classes. The courses. Chicago school is the fourth that I cover. And so that means it's quite late in the game going all the way back to the classical school of economics, this sort of first, the OGs of political economy, if you will, people like Adam Smith and David Ricardo and Jon Stuart Mill, et cetera, et cetera, who had, you know, Adam Smith, first of all, had articulated this labor theory of value that set the stage for understanding why it is that. That items have value to begin, why commodities have value to begin with. That classical school advocates for a free market, but people like John Stuart Mill and I would say Adam Smith too, they say, Yeah, a free market is a great thing, but if things get rough, it is the responsibility of the government to step in to sort of straighten out the market again and then set it back on its free course. So they leave space for interference in the market, if you will. When we get to the middle of the 19th century, so 1848 and post-1848, we come across Marxism, of course, and Marx's magnum opus capital, the subtitle is a critique of political economy. Because what Marx essentially was pointing out is that the economists, the political economists so far had it all wrong and that they were not focusing on profit, the way that profit is accumulated and how it's distributed and how that distribution makes society, socio-economic conditions so unequal for people. And for a lot of economists at the time, it wasn't really a salient or a biting critique as much as maybe we think it is today. For a lot of them, they thought that Marx was applying a theoretical scaffolding onto a political economy which had existed and considered itself a science for so long. So what emerged from that critique was called the Austrian school of economics. The Austrian school of economics is the, we'll say, the grandfather of the Chicago school in the sense that the Austrians came to the table and they said, look, there's a lot more that goes into the decisions that people make when they go to a market and they purchase goods. A lot of those decisions are informed by, for lack of a better word, their ecosystems, the people around them, the church they go to, the music they listen to, the, I don't know, food that they consume, all the culture that's around them influences the way that they make decisions when it comes to money. The problem is that the Austrian school didn't really have data to back any of that up. They were just kind of postulating that people make decisions that are informed by whatever they see as their economic necessity. So we had these kind of competing, we'll say that the Austrians as well as the classical school were liberals, classical liberals in the sense that they did believe in a kind of free market. Marx, not so much. And then the Great Depression happened, 1929, right? This crash of the stock market. And the big figure to come out of that was John Maynard Keynes, right? Keynesianism is the one that is still the economic legacy that lives with us. And Keynes was very much responding to the Great Depression in the ways that states thought that they could remediate the economic disaster that fell from the stock market crash. And Keynes's big intervention, his big addition to this, Keynes was himself a mathematician. He was a socialite, but he was a mathematician. And so he had data and he had numbers to back up his argument, which was essentially that the government needs to intervene in economic crises because capitalism creates crises and it's the responsibility of government through monetary policy to intervene to straighten out the market and then put it back on course. He thought that we could do that through stimulating demand. In another way to put it is if you get people out of their house and into the labor force, those people will earn income, they'll earn money. With that money, they'll start buying things as one would, and that is going to stimulate demand and that will get the economy back going. Whereas a lot of people at the time during the Great Depression thought that the solution was isolationism, to stay in an American market, don't engage too much in global trade, et cetera. This is the moment of America's first isolationary moment, I guess. The Chicago school, in particular, Milton Freeman, come after Keynes and And they pose themselves as a challenge to Keynes from the standpoint of the Austrian position. And so Milton Freeman makes Milton Freeman, George Stigler, Gary Becker, for example, they make many of the same arguments that the Austrians make, except they have numbers this time. And in particular, they champion what's called monetarism and econometrics. These are like creating graphs and charts to sort of make arguments. And their key argument was that you boost an economy by pumping it with money. It's that money. It's the supply of money that will stimulate economic growth. And you do that through central banks. Central banks for them are a good thing. And they even set that up with Pinochet and their dictatorships. And so in that sense, it was very much a critique of Keynes because what they were saying is once you set up the central bank, you can start printing money to stimulate that economy. And then the government doesn't have to get involved. And in fact, the government shouldn't get involved to the extent that everything should be privatized. There should be no government investment in things like roads and parks and other things like that. So they're for privatization to a kind of radical degree. George Stigler, for example, is another one of these Chicago boys that champion the idea of regulatory capture, right? So he, one good example of that is the FDA. And George Stigler would say something like: the FDA is actually nothing but the government interfering in the market in the sense that people who need to pass, let's say, I don't know, a certain drug or a food or something like that, they'll often enter into the government decision-making through organizations like the FDA to capture the regulations to make it favorable for their business. And so Friedman, Stigler, and them would say, no, do away with the FDA because all it's doing is capturing regulation and making the market unfair. And so you asked about the post-New Deal. In that sense, the Chicago School was a response to the extent to which the government stepped into economic regulation to try to get some control over the chaos that ensued from the Great Depression. And Friedman, Stigler, and them were saying, no, no, no, we did it all wrong. That's not the way that you do it. You don't create more government programs and more government organizations. You create less and you incentivize private investors to get involved in those economic stimuli, I guess. So that's what I would say. The sort of long answer that summarizes a lot, I think. Pascal, do you want to have something to follow up on? Yeah, but I told, thanks, by the way. That's a very, very effective, condensed answer. But have we not seen the traumatic and dramatically wrong-headed direction over and over and over again, with the crashes, busts, and bursts of capitalism from the 2008 crash, the 19, the market shock of the early 70s, the crash that happened in the 80s. There were constant busts and bursts of the market under the movements that we've had towards neoliberalism and deregulation that have happened since the end of the Civil Rights New Deal coalition that have brought forth the massive, massive wealth inequality that we have in America today. Yeah. I mean, I sent Jason some videos of Milton Freeman that we can watch and laugh at. But essentially, yeah, you're exactly correct. As much as the Chicago School produced numbers and econometrics, and they said that privatizing everything was good for the economy and pumping it of money was good for the economy, what they couldn't really foresee is the way, Pascal, as you pointed out, that capital has a tendency to kind of coagulate around certain, not even industries, but we'll say companies, right? And that, without any kind of regulation, creates massive profits for some people, but very poor living conditions for everybody else, particularly those who work under the Chicago School, they're not granted unions, right? They have no place in the decision. Making of a business. A business is private property in that sense. And so it's sacred. It's sanctified in that way. So, yeah, you're absolutely right. The Chicago school, as Jason pointed out in the beginning, in its most orthodox practice, turned out to be a failure everywhere it was. And yet, Milton Freeman won the Nobel Prize in Economics. And so there was something about what the Chicago school was promoting and what they were saying that was extremely effective or believable for people at the time. You know, you're coming from, as you said, the, we'll say the height of the civil rights movement, the late 50s into the 60s. And the economy at that point isn't yet fully Chicago style yet. It's still on a gold standard, for instance. And the economy is not doing too well. And not only that, but civil society itself, which people tend to form their politics and their voting decisions more on cultural happenings and what's going on, you know, like our own time, is kind of scaring people into this idea that something is wrong, that there's something wrong, not just with society, but with the economy itself. And so Friedman comes out of this with a new economic idea, one that challenges what had been economic orthodoxy since the New Deal, that is Keynesian economics, and absolutely obliterates it with numbers. And, you know, a lot of people who don't understand economics that well, they see numbers, they see equations, and they're like, huh, yeah, that must be true, right? Because numbers are objective. And so there's no doubt about it. But the truth is that a lot of the equations, a lot of the numbers that the Chicago people create, again, are fabricated in the sense that they're based on postulates, they're not based on objective data. Does that make sense? Yes. Well, another thing I want to ask you about, Alex, is that one of the people who are one of the reasons why Friedman is a sticking point for me is that one of his infamous students is Thomas Sowell. And Thomas Sowell is famous for using Chicago school tactics to discuss what were considered to be the cultural and social pathologies of Black America and explaining their failings as to why they were admiserated with poverty as opposed to the structural failings of capitalism and racism to allow them to really prosper in the United States. Can you talk about how Chicago school economics was used as a means of understanding social phenomenon and how that kind of, if I'm not mistaken, it kind of starts with them, right? That wasn't normally what how economics was used. But all of a sudden, after the Friedman and the Chicago boys, economics starts to become the way in which we start to look at social phenomenon as well. Yeah. The Chicago, I mean, this is again one of the videos that I shared with Jason that we can watch a little bit later, but the Chicago school is very intolerant of, I guess, maybe you could call it social determinism in a way. Right? They don't believe that a free market could ever be like truly unfair in a way. They think this is like the common American ideology that if you work hard, you can achieve anything. And according to the Chicago schools, there's no race, class, gender disparities in any of this. It's all if you work hard, you know, create your own business and make the right investments and make the right moves in that business, then you can level up. And so, in that case, the idea from the civil rights movement that, you know, Black America was majority impoverished because of socioeconomic conditions that they were born in and that they inherited from the past and from the way that slavery was, you know, quote unquote done away with, they wouldn't believe that. They would say, well, if you look at the laws, they're equal, right? We're all equal. We have equal access to the market. And so they're just not using the market effectively. And these social programs, and this is another part of it that they believe, the social programs that by majority were helping black and we'll say non-white Americans at the time were not actually stimulating the economy as much as they were holding the economy back. That's what the Chicago people believed. And that, you know, if you give poor people. Money for social welfare, for example, it's not going to incentivize them at all to participate in the market, and it's not going to give other people a fair leg in the market. I feel like I'm playing devil's advocate here because I want to say that I don't agree with any of that. That's the Chicago, that's the Chicago approach, and that's one that Milton Freeman. You know, as I said in one of the videos I sent Jason, that's one that he explicitly talks about. That, you know, it's not so much your identity, it's your lack of will, essentially. You have to be willing to enter that market. Well, we can pivot to one of those videos now if you guys like. Yeah, let's watch the one where he supposedly slams that student because I think that's the one I'm referring to. Okay, school's young idealist at Stanford. Okay. Yeah, that's the one. Give me one second because, again, my computer moves a little slower. Is this from the Free to Choose Network, which is where I get all my far right-wing clips from as well? Yes. I know. This is where all those Thomas Soule stuff Pascal is on the Free to Choose Network. Yeah, they love that guy. Can you guys see the screen? Yep. All right. I think that you may have just passed over one that is of utmost importance, and that is of poverty. And in prefacing my question, I'd like to refer to what President Kennedy said: that if a free society cannot help the many who are poor, you cannot save the few who are rich. And to say that, well, we are a government of the people. And when there is a large sector of the people who are hurting, perhaps it is the responsibility of this government, of the people, to help out. My question is, is regarding how free are the poor, how free are the unemployed, and how free are those people who are disadvantaged. And so, in reference to that, what is government's role? First of all. Ready for a podcast that moves you to action? Power Beyond Pride is smashing stereotypes and celebrating the fierce, fabulous work of queer change makers.

I'm glad to see one vote for the poor. First of all, the government doesn't have any responsibility. People have responsibility. This building doesn't have responsibility. You and I have responsibility. People have responsibility. Second. The question is: how can we as people exercise our responsibility toward our fellow men most effectively? That's the problem. So far as poverty is concerned, there has never in history been a more effective machine for eliminating poverty than the free enterprise system in the free market. Oh, fuck. The period in which you had the greatest improvement in the lot of the ordinary man was a period of the 19th and early 20th century. Those of us in this room are the heirs of that. We benefited from the way in which our parents and our grandparents were able to come here. And by virtue of the freedom that was offered to them, we're able to make a better life for themselves and ourselves them and us. But next, if you look at the real problems of poverty and denial of freedom to people in this country, almost every single one of them is a result of government action and would be eliminated if you eliminated the bad government failures. Let me be precise and specific. Why do we have so high an unemployment rate among black teenagers? It's a disgrace and a scandal. Why do we have so high an unemployment rate? First of all, because we give them lousy schooling through governmental schools, which make them unqualified to hold decent jobs. And second of all, we require employers to discriminate against them by not hiring them unless they have, unless their productivity is enough to justify a minimum wage. The minimum wage rate is the most anti-Negro law in the books. And it's an anti-Negro law. Pascal, as a Negro, yourself? First of all, let's talk about where he outright lies. The greatest growth of wealth, of actually anti-poverty legislation that happened in this country, was after the New Deal. The quality of life in America during the 19th century when we had slavery in this country. Country and the agrarian South was miserable even up until the early 20th century. This guy's whole standard of history is backwards. One of the greatest expansions of what actually caused the greatest expansion of the middle class in this country was the government programs that come out of FDR and the New Deal, period. So his understanding of history is totally false. And he would never admit that, of course, because he will say, Well, it's the government that was the problem. Then that, that, that, that, that, that's why we have the child of that. Your Milton Freeman impression is great, by the way. I, I, I completely agree with what Pascal says. He has his history is very whitewashed, right? He's saying that we are heirs of what our parents did in the 18th and 19th century, meaning, and then he says, you know, our parents came here. It's like, whose parents? You know what I mean? Like, some of our parents came here. Not all of them came here. Not the people that you're about to talk about. You're about to reference directly. And Pascal, why is minimum wage anti-Negro? I think that's absolutely absurd. I mean, you know, how is minimum wage anti-negro? Minimum wage stops people from getting deflated wages. How is that anti-Negro? So he's saying the fact that you can't pay people a penny an hour is anti-black because it requires them to have to get a fixed labor. If we didn't have to pay a minimum wage, then everyone could work and they could work for two cents an hour and everyone would fine. Like the good old days. Yeah, I mean, yeah, Jason, you're actually on to another point of this, which, like, I hope people who are watching and listening are also. I hope that the bells are ringing in their head because a lot of what Milton Freeman is saying here is exactly what's going on right now. Literally, I mean, people always talk about Trump as the end of neoliberalism, but it's very much not. It's the beginning of neoliberal authoritarianism. So let's see about more anti-Negro law. Because it precisely having first not enabled the young blacks to have a decent schooling so that they can have productivity. I do want to add that it's talking points like that that get people to vote for charter schools as well. Get black people to vote for charter schools as well, because you do have a breakdown of public education, mainly because you're talking about schools that are in places where there's just no tax base, right? Everyone's renting. Maybe the schools are old and run down. So when you hear someone say, well, the schools are broken, that's what the problem is. There's a few problems there, right? First and foremost, teachers just don't make that much money. If we're talking about the urban core, which is pretty much what he's talking about, it's more expensive to live. So if you're already operating from the point of view of a low salary, now you're operating, you have a low salary at a school that doesn't have certain means that could be falling apart physically, meaning you probably have classrooms with no heat. We saw this with this recent election, and I kept bringing this up, where you had a case in a place called Chino Hills, actually a well-to-do area in Southern California, where the superintendent of schools was so busy trying to pass a law and fighting with the state of California, actually, about a law that would require teachers to report home to the parents if students were coming to class as a different gender as the one that was given to them on their paperwork, which no students did in the first place. It was costing the school district millions of dollars to defend against the state's legal actions. While that was going on, it's a very kind of in a valley where this place is. So, several classrooms within the district were broken and had no AC. So, even using the kind of cultural rhetoric really can obfuscate the true problems. Sometimes it happens within the erosion of the public school system. And where you know, you get too busy bogged down in the cultural part and not the real issues. Deny them the honor to job training that they might get if you can induce employers by a low by being able to hire them for relatively low wages to give them on-the-job training that would make them qualify for higher payment and higher productivity. In the third place, we have constructed a governmental welfare scheme which has been a machine for producing poor people. We have induced people to come under control of welfare. I'm not blaming the people, don't misunderstand me. Fault for constructing so perverse and so ill-shaped a monster as a whole set of welfare programs we have under which we encourage people families to break up, we encourage people to move from one part of the country and come to another, under which we have, in effect, made many people poor. And yet, when all this is said and done, have I ever been where? I have certainly, of course, of course, more so than most of the people in this room. He's never been poor. How many of you was did Milton Freeman grow up poor? No. No, he's never been poor. He might have been. I didn't know. Actually, I didn't know his upbringing. Damn. Pascal. He's a loathsome motherfucker, man. I mean, I really despise this guy, man. There's a video he has where he's talking about a guy who's talking about the role of colonialism in underserving third world countries. And Milton Friedman literally makes an argument that colonialism has actually nothing to do with the reason why the third world is underdeveloped. I'm like, oh my God. You're literally going to deny the colonialism. He's like, hello, N-words run it. Timothy, that's why I don't normally do this kind of like people ask me to be in debates with them and stuff like that, but I don't do this kind of platform that he's in where people where I ask questions and somebody answers them because for that reason, you know, people can just go on and they get unchallenged because like your time to talk is over. And then if you try to interrupt them, it's like, no, no, no, no, your question's over. It's time to move on to the next one. And it's like, well, this motherfucker just told like eight lies in a row that I need to like that I don't want these people to believe while he's saying them, you know. All right, let's go. I've worked a 12-hour day and gotten paid 78 cents. But let me go back to the because, but you know, that's all irrelevant. Is there one of you who is going to say that you don't want a doctor to treat you for cancer unless he himself has had cancer? Oh, yeah. I could go down the line. But when all is said and done, while there are people in this country who are worse off than other people, by and large, even the poorest people in this country are relatively well off compared to the conditions in many other countries in the world. This is the richest country in the world. That's like a non-sequitur. It's the richest country in the world, and yet the most unequal country in the world, even in his own time. So you ever argue with conservatives? It's a lot of points like that. It's a lot of analogies that they think are really poignant. And they're like, oh man, I just dunked on you, you socialist scum. But, like, you know, the cancer analogy is like really not that good because, you know, being a medical doctor is not the same as being a fucking like voted upon official or appointed official as somebody that's supposed to improve the lives of people. Because honestly, and I say this in the political economy course, what is the point of economics if not to try to better society and if not to try to allocate resources in a more equitable moral way? And that's what the entire classical school of economics is about. It's all about how do we allocate a finite number of resources in the face of infinite demand. And when you get to somebody like Milton Freeman, it's like, well, that moral dimension is out of it. We're not concerned with that anymore. Now we're concerned with how do we get wealthy? And who is we? Well, the people who have the enterprise, right? Who are entrepreneurial enough to do it, which essentially is the people that have enough capital to start off with, you know? And then that whole part about, you know, when he says, he says, I'm not blaming people. I'm blaming, this is our fault, right? I've heard conservatives say that a lot. Like, I'm not something like that. Like, you know, I'm just playing devil's advocate. It here. I'm not saying that this is your fault or this is their fault. This is like everybody's fault. You know, this is a problem with the country itself. Pascal. This is, it's, it's so, it's so disturbing that young people are now actually starting to follow this line of thinking in larger numbers, man. These, these, these, these guys are their arguments are hitting the Generation Z incel generation more effectively, man, because of the rise of people like Trump.

The basic principles underlying the free market, as Adam Smith taught them to his students in this university, are really very simple. Look at this lead pencil. There's not a single person in the world who could make this pencil. Remarkable statement? Not at all. The wood from which it's made, for all I know, comes from a tree that was cut down in the state of Washington. To cut down that tree, it took a saw. To make the saw, it took steel. To make the steel, it took iron ore. This black center, we call it lead, but it's really graphite, compressed graphite. I'm not sure where it comes from, but I think it comes from some mines in South America. This red top up here, the eraser, bit of rubber, probably comes from Malaya, where the rubber tree isn't even native. It was imported from South America by some businessmen with the help of the British government. This brass ferrule, I haven't the slightest idea where it came from, or the yellow paint, or the paint that made the black lines, or the glue that holds it together. Literally, thousands of people cooperated to make this pencil. People who don't speak the same language, who practice different religions, who might hate one another if they ever met. When you go down to the store and buy this pencil, you are in effect trading a few minutes of your time for a few seconds of the time of all those thousands of people. What brought them together and induced them to cooperate to make this pencil? There was no commissar sending out orders from some central office. It was a magic of the price system, the impersonal operation of prices that brought them together and got them to cooperate to make this pencil so that you could have it for a trifling sum. That is why the operation of the free market is so essential, not only to promote productive efficiency, but even more to foster harmony and peace among the peoples of the world. Now, Alex, who was this freedom for? Friedman argued that free markets guaranteed political freedom. How does this claim hold up when looking at cases like Pinochet's Chile, where economic liberalization coincided with political repression? I really don't want to start. I think Pascal wanted to jump in. I'll get answered back on that. But Pascal wanted to jump in. I want to give it to him. What kind of wanker is this guy, man? He's getting excited over a pencil. Yeah. Like, you can't produce a pencil in a communist country? I mean, what is he talking about? Not as good as his American pencil. That was made with Chinese paint, right? Malayan graphite or something like that. But how do you explain that claim, Pascal? About the free market has been one of the greatest causes of antagonism in human suffering in the world from the age of exploration in the early 1700s when we had the rise of international capital going from slavery from the international colonialization. Imperialism to choose. I mean, you look at what was done. I mean, I look at a country like Haiti where my parents are from. Capitalism has done a wonder over there. Do they have pencils, though?

I want to, I'll add to what Pascal said because what Milton Freeman is pointing out here is essentially like the division of labor. That's classical economics 101. That's Adam Smith, right? Adam Smith says, he uses the example of the pin and says that, you know, it's far easier to produce these in massive quantities when the jobs that go into making the pin are divided amongst very few people. Adam Smith is talking about this process within England, right? With not England, within Great Britain, within the UK, we'll say, not even the empire necessarily at this point yet. But it's happening within the factory setting under the roof of a factory. You have on this side the group that molds the group that forms the pin, et cetera, et cetera. It all happens under one roof. But what Milton Freeman is getting at here is that, yes, in the time, in the moment of global capital, the division of labor has spread itself across the globe. And so, you know, you get rubber from, what do you say, Malaysia, you get the wood, the graphite from South America, and the wood from maybe Washington State, yada yada. And all of that is true, but what Freeman doesn't really get into is, as Pascal's been frustrated about, is the inherent inequalities that go with that division of labor as a global process. And so the people in Malaysia, for instance, that are harvesting the rubber don't make nearly as much as the people that maybe are cutting the trees in Washington or you know anywhere else. And so what that means also is that the profits that are exacted from these pencils, because the wage differentials are so like kind of lopsided, means that there's inherent gaps in wages where profit can be essentially extracted from that. And that's something that Marx writes about, I think, in volume two of Capital, which is that there's this process that almost intentionally obscures wages across different sectors of an industry. And part of the reason for that is so that people don't see the inequalities within the factory setting in terms of the wages that they earn and stuff like that. So, like, he, what he's doing is, again, he's using a classical political economy example of a pencil. And what he says about the pencil on the surface level is absolutely true. No single individual can make this pencil anymore. We live in a world where I don't know how to shoe a horse. Jason and Pascal, you guys, I assume, don't know how to shoe a horse, right? We don't have the same skills that people had in the past to be these kind of pencil craftsmen. A division of labor is an essential process in mass producing the goods that we all want or need in some way. But what he doesn't get into is, again, value, as I think one of the guests pointed out, right? There's no discussion about value or profit here out of the Chicago School because for them, they've done away with the labor theory of value. And Friedman even asks, not how much did these people make, or what were the conditions of these people as they were working on parts of the pencil, but he says, what brought them together, right? This very abstract question. And what brought them together for him is the price points. But, you know, again, that's a very abstract idea. What brings them together is the fact that everybody needs money in order to survive in a world that makes that absolutely necessary. And so people are willing to work for extremely low wages to earn a nickel. That they can afford food or whatever it is in a system that's inherently unequal. The magic of the price system is the other thing that he says. It's all about price, right? There's no discussion about value or profit here. We have this clip of Pascal's favorite black person, Thomas Sowell. As it is now, the school is a monopoly. They need not be responsive. It is hard for me to understand what harm is going to be done by allowing parents to have a choice as compared to having self-interested bureaucrats have a monopoly. As it is, I believe he's talking about public school and the charter system. Pascal? I mean, the history of public schools were originally one of the greatest ways of getting education to former free slaves, slaves who had recently become free. Black people fought for years to get public education. And it was only because racists didn't want to give them the education they deserve that they had to fight and scrap to get the quality of education that they need through historically black colleges, through public school systems, and so on and so forth. So, I mean, if you want to have good public schools, then we just fund them accordingly. Right. Well, here's another video. Alex, you can jump in here if you like, unless you just don't want to talk about white people. I actually do show a clip of Thomas Sewell in my world history class because after the 2008 crash, he was kind of making the rounds in the news and blaming the home buyers and homeowners rather than the banks for the whole thing. If they just pulled up their pants, this wouldn't have been a problem. I think we're talking across purposes. On the one hand, we're talking about results that we're hoping for. On the other hand, we're talking about processes that we're setting in motion. You're saying, should we hope for certain kinds of lessening of inequality and so on? The real question, the political question, is: shall we set in motion certain processes because we hope for that? And do those processes enhance or reduce freedom? And I think the argument that Milton is making, is certainly the argument that I would make is that the attempt at doing these things, and it doesn't really matter, it's a complete straw man to talk about absolute inequality. No, no, no. Absolutely. Throughout the film, this is the straw man he brings up in order to say how ridiculous to have absolute equality. And then he goes on to say how ridiculous to have my equality. The whole point is as a result, you see, that you set up processes whose end result may not be any more or less inequality than exists now. But the question is, those processes may indeed reduce freedom greatly. I would go beyond the question of equality and put it more generally: that any process to ascribe any status to any group of people, equality, inferiority, superiority, must necessarily reduce freedom. Because whatever the government wishes to ascribe to any group, whatever place, to use the phrase that was very common in the South, that blacks should have their place, whatever place the government is going to assign to people, that place will not coincide. That place will not coincide either with what all those people are doing or with how others perceive all those people, because there's too much diversity among human beings. To maintain any system of ascribed status from the top is going to mean reducing people's freedom across the spectrum. That's the point. People have asked that sounds like a lot of gibberish, man. Well, what is he saying for those that don't really understand the word salad? I mean, I don't know. I don't really, I can't get it. I don't know why. I'm like, I'm just trying to figure out what is it, what is he babbling about? Yeah, go ahead, sorry. Go ahead, no, go ahead, Alexander. I understand it as an anti-affirmative action position, right? He's saying that once the government ascribes certain roles for people or certain gives them certain, what's the word? Leverage isn't the right word, but it gives them a certain position, then you're inherently creating an unequal society, is what he's saying. As if his black ass isn't there because of DEI. Did you call him the right-wing DEI, Harry? That's what he is. Government, by its intervention, creates it. People are born into this world in a given sector of a society, and many, many of them are born at the bottom of the society. The argument about equality of results was an argument that was linked to equality of opportunity. People recognize. That, unless there was a degree of equality in a degree of enough food, enough security, access to education, unless these things were available to all children, then equality of opportunity was merely a mockery. That's why equality of results became an issue and it became an issue for black people in the United States. And they expressed their concern, whatever the opinion. You expressed it. Damn it, look. No, they did not. They did not. They am oppressed. They expressed their will by their extraordinary participation in a protest movement that began in the late 1950s and didn't end until intellectuals were not in that protest movement. You want to answer that process. You want me to answer? I finished. Good. Black people have never supported, for example, affirmative action, voters, or anything of that sort. You disagree with the Thomas Sol. Yo, man, listen, man. I can't, I don't want, you know, you're trying to get me upset, man. Cush looks at I agree with Maude. That's Francis Fox Pippin. You know, the right-wingers are setting a right, they have conspiracy theories about her for years, man. They blame her for what was that famous article she pinned? The Frank Francis Fox Pippin Chaos Theory or something like that. You don't have anything to say about what he's getting at? You don't think that there were some black people that opposed affirmative action? Of course, people like him who are on the payoff, who are on the payroll of the Republican right. I mean, these programs were designed to actually deal with the remedy of the racism that was caused by whites being unwilling to employ, hire, or educate black people who are qualified, not unqualified. Well, wouldn't according to Thomas Sowell, the whites just find the good blacks. Like, you know, this is an argument that I've, I so there are some people that I grew up with that are like they are conservative, but they'll never admit it. And instead, they just like drop a message in my DMs, like pretending to ask a question, but what they really do is stating their opinion. And this is one that I got into with someone. It was about DEI and stuff. And he's, I'm not going to say what his job is, but he, let's just say, like, he knows a lot about the police, the police departments, and how they operate. And he was telling me about how unequal affirmative action in DEI is in the police because he was saying, you know, you go to go to training for the police and you might do far better than all the like non-white and the women that are that are training to be cops. And yet, because you're a white male, you're not going to get the job. And he's saying, you know, that shouldn't be the case. It should be strictly based on performance and nothing else. It should be based on like your merit. And I was like, well, isn't merit something that is like created? It's not something that you're born with, right? Nobody is born with merit. Nobody, I mean, yeah, maybe there's some savants who know how to play Beethoven at age five or something like that, but I haven't ever met one, you know. So maybe there are people that are born with an exceptional amount of merit, but the truth is that merit is something that is created, it's not something that is you just have it, you know. Here's Piss Pascal for two minutes. Matters of should people be paid equally or should there be this or that? Black people have never taken a position that you describe. So it is not a question of what black people chose to do. It's what you choose to put in the mouths of black people. It's what you choose to project. It is not what any black people have ever said anywhere that you can put your foot on. What do you choose to put into the mouth of the pollsters as far as I can see? Like most people, I have never seen a pollster. If you look at the leadership of the black, I want to go back to the, I want to carry it back to the earlier point. Number one, there's no question but what equality of results, if it comes about through a framework of freedom, is a desirable result. Number two, I argue in the film, I've argued here, that in point of fact, you get greater equality of actual results by a system under which people are free to achieve unequal results that for the poor people. What? What also people have to understand, too, and for those watching this that don't know, it's pretty much Francis Fox Piven in a room full of very conservative economists and maybe a handful of students. And that's the way these things were set up. So almost like your new favorite show, 20 verse 1. But seriously, these Harvard debates were not fair. And this is going to sound bad. I do appreciate the fact that people let each other talk. Even though Seoul does try to do some ad hominem attacks. Fox Piven was talking about. The most effective mechanism for enabling them to improve their status is not a governmental program which seeks to ascribe to them certain positions, which seeks to provide them with certain goods and services, but a governmental program which tries to eliminate arbitrary barriers to advancement. I would say that in this world, the gall of him saying that in front of Thomas Soule, who only exists in the world because he was a beneficiary of the GI bill, is comical. That's a good point. Thomas Soul won't went to college because of the GI bill. Tony Rey says he's arguing the boilerplate ideology: leave markets alone and human freedom, and best or optimal results will happen. But also importantly, what he's saying is that some people have to fail in order for others to achieve, to win, which is like a kind of Malthusian argument, right? Thomas Malthus is another one of these classical economics who he's kind of like the great grandfather of Milton Freeman, who said, you know, Britain shouldn't be giving any kind of social welfare to the poor because what that's going to do is they're going to eat all of our food, we're going to run out of food supply, and all the people that are actually hard-working Britons will starve. And so, he so Malthus's argument was, we got to let the poor just starve. He was an advocate of population control, too. Yep. Of inequality has been special privileges granted by government. That government, you may talk a great deal. There may be a lot of talk about how we're going to eliminate inequality. But if you look at, go back to your case of Britain, is there any doubt that one of the effects of governmental intervention in Britain has been to create new opportunities for special classes? That the way to get wealthy in a society that supposedly is aiming at equality, that the way to get wealthy is to get a special government permit to import to get foreign exchange or to import goods or to in this country to set up a television station. Elon Musk, 101. That's how you do it. You get government subsidies. Yo, these, I is too much for you, Pascal. Your nervous system is shook. I hate these motherfuckers, man. I really like it's really, it makes it clarifies, it frustrates me that we have such a weak left because the liberals can never, never challenge these guys it's gonna it has to be strong radical leftists with good arguments rooted in political economy that shut these guys down. Because liberals have no critique of capitalism. So, as a result, particularly in the post-neoliberal age, they're not going to be able to challenge these guys. But we have to have a strong left, strong radicals to really come at these guys to be able to neutralize them, or else they're going to eat our lunch, man. Yeah, that's kind of the main purpose of my class: to try to, I think that in order to. I appreciate the work you do, Alexander. I think what you're doing is important here to really, you know, dissecting what these guys really think and make people really understand what is the problem because there's so many young people now who are just going on YouTube and watching old Thomas Sowell videos and like, oh, Thomas Sowell has brought that. Oh, my God. Melton Freyman, did you see how he ate Francis Fox Payman's lunch? And I don't mean to make any assumptions, but think about how many young black men have also seen Thomas Sowell. Oh, I'm afraid it's bigger than you think. Yeah. A lot more people than I even thought watch a lot of that bullshit. But do you want to say we've been talking for about an hour now? Do you want to say something in closing, Alex, before we go about the class and what people get out of it? Yeah, I want to say, I mean, if you enjoyed this very brief discussion on Milton Freeman and stuff, I believe that in order to be, as Pascal said, an effective radical, somebody that can engage with these people, you have to know them, right? You have to know your enemy. That's radical politics 101. And there's a lot of people that they jump into something like reading Marx, not knowing who David Ricardo or Adam Smith really are, or they have some idea that they learned in high school about mercantilism and Adam Smith's free market. But you really have to kind of dive into this stuff and understand it on a historical continuum in context to really understand where somebody like Milton Freeman came from and why his argument, as Pascal was hinting at in the beginning, why it was so salient when it came out, why it was so convincing for some people. And so the class, I hope, and again, Andrea has been boosting it in the chat, but as I hope people are really interested in this can kind of learn with me. And, you know, we watch some of these videos insofar as they exist and laugh about them. We go all the way from the classical school to supply side economics, which up until Trump was really the major liberal orthodoxy was supply side. That was like Reaganomics. Trump has changed that a little bit. It's no longer supply side. Now it's the producers, right? It's all about the capitalists and how to boost their pockets at the expense of supply. So we talk about all of this stuff and I hope to see you there. And if you want to sign up, you go to patreon.com/slash courses with Alex. And then you go into shop and you'll see the political economy. You pay for it there. And then after you pay for it, you get access to a Google Doc. The Google Doc will have a link to the Telegram channel where all of your classmates, including me, will be on the Telegram channel. We can chat, we can share memes, we can shoot the shit there. It will have a link to the Zoom meeting room where each class will be. And it will have a sort of syllabus. These are the assigned readings, and these are what we're going over that class. So I hope to see you there and have fun. And then we'll begin at the last week of September when round two is starting. Well, like I said, wherever you guys are watching or listening to the show, there's links in the description. The first line before we even talk about what the show is going to be about is a link to Alex's class. Thank you, Pascal. Thank you, Alex. Thank you, everybody watching and people that listen. Again, if you are a patron of the show or one of our paid YouTube subscribers, the link is already up. We are going to have a fun-ass movie night. My birthday was yesterday because I had to drop off a house guest six hours away. We'll be watching Better Off Dead tonight. It'll be fun. I promise. Oh, one more thing I should say. I'm sorry, I didn't do that. You should definitely do the movie night with Jason, first of all. Now, I have personally, in person, watched movies with Jason, and it's a lot of fun. He's just a wealth of information. But what I wanted to say is, I meant to say that my courses have been picked up by Means TV. And so I'll be offering them through Means TV in the not so distant future, which means that I don't know if the price or the format is going to change. And so if you really want to have a more personal format before it gets flooded with Means TV people, this might be your last chance to do it with me. And so that's another incentive to jump in now while you can. I just wanted to add that I was supposed to announce the Means TV thing. I totally forgot. I blanked on it because I'm terrible at this stuff. I didn't know. They didn't tell me. So congratulations. There you go. Two Means TV people here. So that's literally what I was working on: the follow-up to one of the videos I have on Means TV. So I will see you guys in a little bit for the watch party. We are. Out. Out. Tony Spezzi here with Triple A Heating and Cooling. The heat is here, and you're doing your best to cool off, dragging that sad inflatable pool out from the garage. You know, the moldy one slowly leaking onto your lawn while the kids scream. Yeah, it's a vibe. If your actual AC system is acting like an inflatable pool leaking and barely holding on, maybe it's time to give us a call. We'll help you stay cool without the tarp or the panic. AAA Heating and Cooling. CCB number 222.
