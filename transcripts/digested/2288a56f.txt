I'm your host, Jason Miles. Our returning listener, subscribers, and our very valued patrons. Hell yeah! You are the driving force behind the TIR machine. Without you, we couldn't do this. If you're new to this channel and enjoy what we do, please hit like and subscribe. It is a passive gesture that goes a long way. Also, for viewers of the main show, we will be back tomorrow night talking about Lodera Metallica with my very good friend and fellow musician, singer and guitar player for the Atlas Moth, and motherless Stavros Giannopoulos. I've known Stavros for quite a while now, and he has some very serious opinions about that era of that band. As you know, TIR is a listener-supported labor of love. If you dig what we do here and have the means, become a patron or a paid YouTube subscriber, you'll have access to champagne rooms, be able to join us for our movie nights, and get the satisfaction of knowing you are part of making sure this insanity can continue. Now, on to the show, why you're here, Raja Jackson's Rampage. We live in an era where attention is currency. What seems like a casual scroll through social media is actually a transaction. Our glance is tracked, packaged, and sold back to us. In this world, celebrity is the great disruptor, the thing that makes us stop. And today, even politics has been swallowed by celebrity logic, turning what once looked like civic duty into theater, spectacle, and hype. That's where the language of pro-wrestling, K-Fabe, becomes useful. In wrestling, K-Fabe is the unspoken agreement never to break character. Rivalries, betrayals, and outbursts might be scripted, but the illusion has power and fans stay hooked. Politics works the same way. It's not about truth, but performance. Which brings us to the strange case of Raja Jackson, MMA fighter and son of Rampage Jackson, who recently jumped into a wrestling ring in Sun Valley, California. What began as a staged work, a planned altercation involving a beer can to the head, spiraled into something far more violent, leaving one wrestler unconscious and a live audience wondering, is this real? Was it a part of this show? This incident is more than just a ringside brawl. It's a parable about K-Fabe itself, about how controversy, outrage, and heat are manufactured to sell tickets, drive clicks, and turn nobodies in the stars. And in our politics, just like in pro wrestling, it's increasingly hard to tell the difference between a work shoot and the chaos that comes when the performance goes too far. Now, to talk about this incident with me, I have my co-host and my dog, also a massive wrestling fan. Please welcome Macadosa Shrek. Hello, everybody. And uh-oh, we have a special. Oh, no, a special guest descending from the top. Here comes JG Michael! Thanks for the entrance. You can't beat a Jim Ross entrance, man. I'm sure you weren't expecting that, JG. That's got to be the best entrance you've had. That was out of nowhere. Everything. Just like an RKO. Everything about this incident is out of nowhere. JG and I were talking last night about it. I am under the illusion, let's say, that this was some sort of work. The whole thing starts, Raja Jackson is a special guest, if I'm not mistaken, from one of the wrestlers, and he's with his people. And they're recording everything backstage. And it seems pretty mundane because the backstage is such a small promotion. It's just a parking lot. And guys seem to be getting ready, and they're just kind of talking amongst each other. And one wrestler named Psycho Stu walks up to Raja and hits him with the beer can. But the way he hits him, he's not injuring him. It looks worse than it is. And he hits him and he says, Are you going to sell it? And everyone's kind of looking at him and people start lightly grabbing Raja and Stu and kind of breaking apart. Stu even grabs the back of Raja Jackson's head as if to grapple and says, Are you going to sell it? And Jackson doesn't say anything. So you can, you can, we can have the argument, and I'm here to listen that he really didn't know at that point. I would say, if I didn't know, and I'm not a professional wrestler, and I literally came down there on a friend's request just to see a match, I'd leave. And if I have my manager with me, he would tell me it's time to go. You just got hit. This isn't what you do for a living. Apparently, he was recovering from a concussion in a sparring match. So according to his dad. According to his dad. So you grab your person and you leave. And if you're part of the wrestling promotion and you've done this to a professional athlete who can get litigious, you probably would be extremely apologetic and, you know, hope that person doesn't sue or press some sort of criminal charges if they weren't in on the bit. Jackson doesn't leave. How many hours has he stay there for? Like five until he gets his quote-unquote receipt. Do you are you okay, JG? Oh, you look mad. No, no, no, no. I was coughing. Oh, I turned off my mic. You're coughing. It was a few hours later that the match happens. Yeah. So while he's waiting for the match to happen, he's taken aside by one of the wrestlers. And when he gets hit, you can hear other wrestlers saying he's not a worker. He's not working. He's not a worker, meaning he's not privy to the things that go on when people see cameras. If you see cameras, you're on, which I thought was interesting. Let's just say it's not a work. That means that these cats are kind of so trained. Oh, there's cameras. We're on.

Let's go. Let's turn this into a thing because we have time to work out a thing we can do during the match afterwards. And they end up telling, I can't think of the wrestler's name right now. He tells Raja Jackson, explains to him what a receipt is. AJ Mana. That was, by the way, AJ Mana is the guy who brought Raja in as his guest. I think they trained together at some point. Yeah. They trained MMA together? I think they trained at like the same gym. I don't know the details. Okay. I think they were gym buddies, probably. As AJ's a buff dude, too. These other wrestlers are more old-school wrestler shape. You know, they're not super roityy looking. Well, except for the guy who got Raja off. He was a shit. Yeah, the epic Doug Mallow. Yeah. Who I've been watching a lot of his videos post this as well. But he explains what a receipt is. And JG, stop me if I'm saying this wrong, but in a ring, it's kind of this way of almost like self-policing. If someone's too rough, if things are too hard, someone hits you, it's kind of a present. And you got to give them their receipt back. That's not exactly like punching a dude like 20 times in the face, though. It isn't. It's a one-for-one. Now we're even the slate's clean. We continue to quote unquote work. He explains this to Raja, but in the interim before the incident happens, um, Raja Jackson is live streaming. His dad is live streaming, and they're live streaming on a newer platform called Kick, which is a very controversial. Platform. We should talk about that. And we can definitely get into that later because I think that plays a role in it. And this is where for me things get really, really blurry. Um, is Raja's getting a lot of negative comments about him being a bitch from some from his father? Well, his father has a tendency to call him. I was gonna say that that tracks because let's face it, Rampage took one too many shots to the head from people who hit way too hard. Um, Rampage was a fearsome dude in his prime, um, but like some of our favorites from that era, you know, Chuck Liddell, uh, you could even say Couture, um, back, those types of guys that kind of came in at the when we start UFC start becoming what it is. Um, they were all punch drunk by the end and had no business getting in a cage, like whatsoever. Um, and I really think at this point in time, Rampage's brain is probably smooth enough to skip across a pond about 20 times. Damn. Um, and I'm not saying that lightly as someone who's taken blows to the head myself. Um, you really want Rampage to accidentally see one of us and just leg kick the shit out of me, huh? I think Rampage has even bigger problems than just the uh, you know, the punches to the head. I, I, I don't know. I thought it was interesting. Do you know where he was at when this was happening, Rampage Jackson? No, where was he? He was at a bar with uh Sneeko. That sounds good. Sneeko was the one that informed him what happened. And Rampage was like, I hope it's I hope it's like that hardcore wrestling, and this is not a big thing. Okay, this is what I'm going to say to that. You having an unnatural allegiance to losers does not like you. I think it highlights. I don't know. I mean, we'll get into this later, but I like wrestling and I like combat sports and MMA, but I also have a real issue with how I'm not big on talking about like toxic culture in the way like some rad libs are, but like the wrestling in MMA and combat sports culture can be very toxic, dude. And I really think it's only getting worse. Yeah. Well, that's why people are hanging out with Sneeko from the end. Sneeko himself, an acolyte of you know, but it's just like it's it's starting the slide into just I mean, the we had a we've got a gym here in Fayetteville, Jason, that's like trained guys that have actually made it to UFC, Bellator, Strike Force when it was around. And they got two alum that are fighting in PFL. And dude, that place turned into like white nationalist central in town. Yikes. And it's just, I don't like, well, I kind of do know. Like, we all know why that type of shit kind of grows around gyms like that. You know, the macho bravado, all that nonsense. You know, it's just, it's always kind of been there. Like, like it's been there in boxing gyms. Um, you know, the really shitty thing about boxing gyms was you'd get this group of like white dudes who would only train it one time. You get like the black dudes would only train it one time, Hispanic dudes would only train it one time, right? Like they would never like you didn't see a lot of uh training together, even if you had the same coaches and trainers, you know. Um, and it was always like an unspoken thing, but like when the kind of growth of MMA, like it's out in your face. I mean, you got people like uh Cody Garbrandt that are just two seconds away of just throwing up a Hitler salute. Is he the guy that says all the crazy shit? Uh, like COVID denier and a bunch of other insane Cody, Cody's one of the loudest ones that they're a dime at dozen in that world. By the way, that that person who said the MMA fan base is more toxic than the pro wrestling fan base. I agree. I'm not just talking about the fan base, though. I mean the actual like you mean the participants, yeah. I mean, and to be honest, it's been that way forever. I mean, it's a carney industry, it's a it's like it's like being around comedians, right? It's a gnarly world, it's a tough world where kind of you're being paid to be tough. You know, those punches, granted, some they're pulled to a certain degree, the mat is real, the chairs are real, the nails are real, the LED lights are real, the falling from a roof to a table is real. You can try to prevent a certain amount of injury, but when you see these cats, especially the old school wrestling cats, they would just stay cutting themselves, you could put a quarter in some of those wounds those dudes have. So if you want to talk about like quote-unquote toughness, like you're dealing with people that when they say take it not just the toughness, though, I mean, it's a culture. I mean, the industry itself originates on the carney sort of circuit. And I hate to put it this way. This sounds like harsher than it is, but it, I mean, a lot of those old school wrestlers from like, you know, the really early days of pro wrestling would have been like criminals if they weren't wrestling. Yeah. Yeah. Some of them were. Yeah. We're talking about the era where people got murdered. Yeah. I read the book early this year, written by the mask wrestler, you know, that went into the history of professional wrestling. Yeah. And like literally the first few chapters discussing the territorial era, where how, you know, like in the Northeast, the promoters were really just mob guys. And when they, if they didn't bring enough gate receipts in, Jason, they were like, okay, you, Italian guy, you, Irish guy, you're going to get into a fight in this bar. And then the third guy, yeah, you over here, you're going to rob it. Just so we can cover down on this on gate. Yeah. It's a dirty industry. Like there's a lot of industries that get cleaned up through things like, this is going to sound ridiculous, people like credit cards. Like live music was a very filthy industry before the ubiquity of credit card machines. You know, we're talking about like bags of cash, lots of ass whoopings behind stages. I even was backstage at a show years ago, and we were with a guy that was an old tour manager from the early days of Wu-Tang, and they were playing some crazy circuit in the south. And again, I don't know. Wait, Wu-Tang was playing a circuit in the South? In the South. They got clan in their name. A bunch of white guys showed up and they're like, hey, what the fuck is going on here? It was worse, Mac. They said it was a factory. The guy said it was a factory when they got there. It was a black promoter, actually. It was a factory when they got there. And they didn't think it was going to be a show. They're like, is this going to be a show? Because yeah, don't worry about it. And by whatever time the show was supposed to start, they kind of cleared the stuff out for the factory. They put up a PA and the place was packed. At the end of the night, because they hadn't made an agreement, there's a thing called back end, which means if you sell the room out, you get a cut of the door over your guarantee. And so the tour manager was a white British man and he went to go collect. And the guy goes, oh, it didn't sell out. He's like, what are you talking about? This is like, there were people everywhere. And he goes, nah.

Ah, it didn't sell out. And he goes, and he starts getting mad. And I'm going to call, I'm going to sue. And he says the promoter then puts a gun on the table and goes, it didn't sell out. And all the words they do. Okay, it didn't sell out. Thank you very much. I mean, now that you mention it, I saw some space. I think only half the room was filled. I mean, I'm sorry. I just, it might have been the lights threw off my vision for a little bit. But there's there, these are cash industries where there's a lot of criminality. Nightclubs are the same way. You know, there's a cash industry. There's going to be criminality behind it. And you're going to have some quote-unquote unsavory characters. And they're going to build the culture of the industry. It's with wrestling. It's not just that. It's like it literally originates in con mannery. So like back in the days of like really, really early wrestling, like going back to the 1800s when you had people like William Muldoon. I mean, literally it starts as they have these strongman contests and things of that nature, catch wrestling. And then they say, well, you know, we have all these marks coming in. What if we like rig the matches and then bet on each other and make more money off? You know, it's, it literally originates in, I mean, it's, it's Carney stuff. It's, you know, it's a con. You're trying to find the mark that you want to separate their money and get it for yourself. So again, I think when you're dealing with this kind of, I don't want to say nefarious world, but a world that just constantly moves in trickery. And to me, it's a fun house hall of bears. That's what, that's what K-Fabe is, in my opinion. I think it's something that's always moving. Works and shoots are always happening, and shoots turn into works all the time. Yeah, my question is: with this incident, um, and again, I think everybody here has seen it. And I think we all agree. We hope uh, Psycho Stew is okay, yeah, you know, but we also don't know he could be walking around cracking up right now. We don't know anything. How do you guys feel about the whole thing as far as Mac? How do you feel? Let me get a Mac. I mean, the thing is, is like we were talking about before we started, you know, we're seeing the biggest game in town essentially pulling back the curtain so you can see how the sausage is made now. Like, at this point, we all know that this is just soap operas for bros, right? Like, there's no mark, so to speak, now, okay. With that being said, right? Um, I think on the independent scene, you might still see some guys that are performers, I should say. Um, because it's not just dudes, you know, like there, there are some old school women that, yeah, you know, think that it should be like it was during the 80s, you know, um, that still want to keep this thing going, the facade, right? You know, like when we see Gunter shit talking Goldberg in front of his kid, right, who was a college football player and also has a WWE NIL deal himself, okay, you know, like we know this isn't real animosity, this is part of the drive to uh, the main event of uh fuck JG, what show was it where it was Gunther and Goldberg? Um, was it it might have been Saturday night's main event? That was Saturday night's main event. You know, it was to the main event of that show, right? Like, but we know that Goldberg and Gunther probably high-fived and hugged it out at, you know, behind the curtain. You know, it's just if this was a work that got out of hand, or if it was just bullshit overall, like as weird and varied as the wrestling community is, right? Like, we all know bullshit when we see it at this point. Um, you know, like, why, why run it this hard? You know, why? I just, I don't get it. Do you think though, do you think that we're in a moment? Because what's interesting to me about the whole, what you said about how the sausage is made, I think you need to show the sausage being made for Kayfabe to work, right? From the political standpoint, you need Donald Trump to come out and say, I know the game is rigged because I was part of the people rigging the game. Yeah. Now, everything he says is bullshit, but he gives you this illusion that you're coming in and understanding how everything works. During the 90s, a lot of stuff happened in the backstage of wrestling television shows because that was also a style of talk shows. And those two things were kind of working in unison a bit as far as when you see Maury Povich follow the young lady in the back, and you see the cameras, you see the skinny hallway, you see the gaff tape, the producer with that kind of microphone headset, and he's like, Hey, hey, we're going to have you back on. We're going to find the father to your bastard child, right? When you see that, you're being let in that Maury's really a nice guy. This really was about finding the dad as crazy as it was. And now you're kind of in on this, you're following the story. Do you want to know why? Do you want to know why Maury did that, though? It's because he spent so many years getting cucked by worm baby. That's why. I mean, here's the thing with the backstage stuff and the like, oh, we're admitting that it's a performance, which that has been going on for years and now it's sort of in hyperdrive. I've maintained that's not just for the sake of the audience. It's not just for the audience. McMahon knew this early on, right? When he was doing the national expansion. And I'm not saying that as like faint praise to McMahon because he's a pretty horrible person, as I think we all know. But, you know, guys like Ole Anderson, when they would talk to TV executives, Ole Anderson helped run Georgia Championship Wrestling back in the 80s, you know, on it was on Turner and whatnot before WCW. He would, if he talked to a TV executive, he would say, well, it's real. It's real. McMahon always wanted to tell the TV executives, oh, of course it's fake, but it's funny, isn't it? Seeing the big guy beat up the little guy, her. And, you know, TV executives are less annoyed by that in a way. You know, like when Ole Anderson would say it's real, or one of those old school guys would say it's real, those TV executives would be like, why is this guy trying to insult my intelligence? In a weird way, WWE has always gone after the biggest mark, which is the TV companies. They want that. They're always looking for the new Netflix deal or the Saudi deal. You know, they're not even looking for the biggest mark for them isn't the fan. It's the people, the money marks. Yeah. You know, if that makes sense. Well, it's working. That's part of the reason why they go through the whole like rigorum roll of, well, wrestling isn't wrestling. It's a soap opera with athleticism, you know, that type of thing. Yeah. It's, it's, I mean, you got to think. And this is, this will be the one time I give McMahon credit for anything that he's done in the last 20 years or so. Saying it's sports entertainment. Right. It is. It's sports entertainment. Part of that was to avoid the athletic commissions, but another part of it was he's trying to sell it. He's trying to sell it to TV networks and stuff. And really, like, TV networks looked at it and was like, oh, these shows take place in smoky rooms. Now, smoky rooms doesn't mean small venues necessarily because there were big shows in wrestling before McMahon. God, yeah, they were in auditorium before McMahon. But, you know, I mean, at the end of the day, like, it's seen as the TV executives looked at it as ah, this is, you know, this is what we want. And he's always trying to sell it to them. That's why he used these terms like sports entertainment. That's why WWE operates the way it does. But back to the whole, the whole Raja Jackson situation. Do you not agree that it's a work from jump, JG? I think it turned into a work, and then I think it turned into a shoot. And there's a reason I say that, and I need to put this very carefully. Sure. I think wrestlers can be very crafty people. I think they are incredible performers. I think they understand, you know, like mass psychology in a weird way that normal people wouldn't just because of how they're trained. But I also think wrestlers can have very low emotional IQs at times and also can be very hot-headed and also can get dumb ideas in their head without thinking them through. It's a very weird culture. I've seen the type of ribbing that goes on with wrestlers. That can get very like childish. And I think what happened was Stu didn't know what was going on and he hit Raja with a bear can thinking, oh, you know, he's a worker. He's disrespecting me. Or he did it as a rib, you know, a rib being a prank. And then it asked.

Escalate it because Raja was like, Why are you disrespecting me? And then they told him, Oh, Raj is not a worker, man. Raj is not a worker. And then I think Black Pearl, the Simone wrestler who helps run the company, he said, Well, why don't we turn it into an angle? I think that I don't think this was planned out from like day one. And the reason I think that is, I think you're overestimated how smart some of these people are. I wouldn't, I mean, look, I'm looking. I'm trying to be mean about it because I think wrestlers are smart enough to be able to get it. I'm looking at it normally. If you're saying, because isn't that Rikishi's son? He's yeah, they're related somehow. Yeah, it's if that's if that's if that's the case, then that means you grabbed his people. Because again, there's there's the reality of I'm looking at it from the standpoint of your people are probably so far removed from this world that if they see you get hit with a beer can and you're their paycheck, they can't wait to take you out of there. They probably wanted to leave anyway, so you got to grab that guy quick and be like, Hey, this is what we're going to do. And what is it worth to you? You know what I mean? Yeah, that's why I'm looking at it from the standpoint of, I get what you're saying, but everybody has to be on board. And if I'm like, if I'm if I'm managing a band and that shit happened, ain't nobody telling me shit. I'm not even giving the band a chance to listen to the talk. Fuck out of here. This asshole just hit somebody with a beer can. Oh, cool. I don't care. Fuck these people. We don't need them. And then you leave. Do you know how many times we've left? So my only response to that is: I think wrestling is different than any other world in the entertainment industry. But he's not a wrestler. We're not talking about a wrestler. That's my point. We're not. We're not talking about a wrestler. Yeah. I mean, I could see that to a point, but Raj has also grown up in the public eye, right? Just because of who his dad is. And let's face it, indie show or big leagues, right? If you're a name and you go to a wrestling show, you know you're going to be involved in some way. Like, it could just be you sitting there, the camera's going to pan to you, right? They're going to be like, look, here's Britch dickhead number one. You know, how many times have we seen Tyrese Halliburton on camera in the last year, JG? You know, like he's been on camera like at least half a dozen times, right? That's just, that's the name of the game. If you're famous, I mean, fuck, Selena Gomez was in the crowd. And, you know, she was rocking Alexa Bliss's jacket and they had the camera on her. Like, it's just a thing. That is like part and parcel of it. So, like, if you think that Raja Jackson isn't like going to be involved in some way, shape, or form, I think that's a nonsense thought. Now, if you want him to get more involved, you probably should give him a heads up, you know, and not just come out of left field with a fucking beer can. You know, but it's, oh shit, Jason, please be careful. Please be careful. Did you see me go like this? I like looked over. So I saw a head walk by. There's like a breezeway that leads to my terrace. And I was like, Who the fuck is walking in my house? And there's, I open my door and doors. There's this white woman. She goes, Hi. She's like, I just moved in next door. She goes, I thought it was a public little space, and it's, it's not, it's, it's someone's house. It's like, yeah, yeah, I live here, white lady. Yeah, yeah. She, she, she was, she was terrified. Uh, rightfully so. Um, but yeah, that's why I took off because I thought I was being invaded. You know, but like if you want to work, you know, Raja, you know, Raja Jackson, Rampage's kid, who's done his own wrestling thing a time or two himself, then you sit down and talk to him about it prior to because he may be you know an MMA fighter, and I've never seen his fights. I didn't even know he was active, to be honest. I just thought he was Rampage's kid. Um, but you know, he can take care of himself. You can't just have a guy who's, you know, Psycho Stew's been in the industry for fucking ever. You know, he, if you're working with another wrestler and you do something from the hip, that's one thing. But bringing in somebody else, you know, who's not privy to, like JG said, kind of like the cultural aspects of wrestling, you're asking for trouble. That I agree on 110%. I think all of us agree on that. I think that's the main thing. You have a guy that is everything is going to be different. Again, back to the whole, if your people are there and that happens, I don't give a shit about the culture of whatever the fuck I'm here for. Yeah. This isn't what we do. And we have to leave. But another reason why I don't think he left, I think there was money involved. That's why I think there was a setup. I should add something here. You know, I guess what I was trying to say before is, in my experience, wrestlers are not necessarily the greatest people at reading the room. And that was sort of my takeaway from it. No, I'm not being mean about it, but like, it's a very like, it can be a paranoid and often like narcissistic industry. And then you're dealing with like a million different things at once. There's backstabbing. There's, you know, a few like very real friendships. But it's like a being involved in that industry is being involved in a whirlwind at all times. So I think guys sometimes don't read the room properly until they get into the ring, you know? Yeah, I mean, and that's the thing. Isn't that the weird thing about it, JG? Is you have a lot of people who I would even argue after having met some independent wrestlers, I haven't met any big name ones. They're kind of emotionally stunted. I did not want to put it that way, but I mean, dude, I always put it this way. I was in the military for a long time, right? I have a theory that you stop maturing at the age in which you join the military. I think that's a lot of wrestlers. You stop maturing when you get into the industry. You know, so you have a lot of grown-ass adults that act like children that don't properly know how to convey in words. But, like you said, when you get in the ring, dude, you know, they're business. Like, that's what they're doing, man. And they could, they know how to feed off their opponent. And, you know, if something gets missed, they know how to make the best, you know what I mean? Like, they know what they're doing in there. But, like, if you ask them to sit down and talk, a lot of these wrestlers, it's just like it's mind-blowing how they just don't know how to convey in words, like what's going on in their head. I mean, it's nuts to me. You know, Dizzle says something kind of interesting. Shout out to Dizzle. I think his people got content brain because you grown, Jason. You don't understand these content-brained assholes. Maybe that's what it is. And they're just looking at it from the standpoint of we can stream this and we can spend it and we can get views and we get this. Because I was reading how Kik pays people. And I guess they pay people. Dig this. If you're a big enough name, you get paid hourly on a streaming service. Yep. Okay, who funds Kick? We don't talk about fuck club. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, who is funding that? Because you got to think: if it's Twitch Light or whatever the fuck you want to call it, Twitch got gobbled up by Amazon and they still fight to pay out content creators. You know, so who's fucking Mr. Money Bags behind Kick? That's like, you know what, bro? You're the bastard son of an athlete. Guess we'll pay hourly. You know, like, look, you get paid hourly. You get up to 95% of your subscriptions to the site when people subscribe to your thing. It's, you know, how Twitch was like that too when it first started. People were making pretty decent money with Twitch. And I guess they're trying to, you know, get people out of the site so you want to get names or you want to get events. So the whole thing feels like heat may be coming from kick because one of the things that Rampage said, maybe this is me reading too much into it, is I apologize to kick for this whole thing. Again, I'm JG, you could be 100% right that the kid really didn't know what was going on. He gets hit with a beer can, and someone takes his people aside quick, fast, in a hurry. He says, don't leave. This is the plan. We're going to spend this to a thing. We're streaming it on Kik. We're going to get subscriptions. And the money will roll right in as the Fang song goes.

Um, but what is the big like blind spot for me is this young man, and he's like 25, yeah, and I don't know, I don't know if his dad is all K fave, I don't know if his dad on a camera is just a real horrible talking person. And when the cameras are off, he's constantly hugging his son and telling him how wonderful he is. I don't know, but on camera, definitely a candidate for a CPS phone call. Um, how real is the insults for the kid? Because afterwards, because also, too, the punches were kind of wild. And I'm like, does he think this dude is pretending to be out and he's really out and he doesn't know? Or does he see his father's face and he's unloading on maybe the biggest bully anyone can grow up with? Yeah, 23 years of just dad calling me a bitch. Did it feel like seriously, Mac? You watched it too. Is that how you felt? I mean, I'm not gonna lie, man, it caught me off guard when I saw it. You know, because like I am a wrestling nut, and you know, fuck JG can attest this. You know, you get the guy that charges in, you know, five or six wild punches where they're looking like they're having this devastating effect. Then people rush the ring, they pull him off, and then it's just shit talking, right? That's what I was expecting. Yeah, I just think Rasha Jackson may be someone with uh like zero emotional regulation. I mean, you know, a lot of people are calling him a kid, and everyone else is pointing out that he's like a 25-year-old grown man. But I think what people mean kid when they say that about him, I think it's, I mean, he just seems like he is not a very uh well-grounded person. You know what? I'm I would agree with that too. Yeah, I mean, this looks like a dude. I mean, let's face it, like Rampage is one of the guys that didn't like bust his entire nut from his winnings, you know. Um, he may be a guy that should be liable for a CPS call. Um, did you happen to see what he was saying before? Not to interrupt you, but did you happen to see him like two weeks ago or something like that in an interview where he's like, I saved up a lot of money for my Jappa, and I could, I swear he did a portmanteau and stopped himself in the middle of the interview. He was calling his Asian kids Jappa N-wards, and then he stopped himself and said, My Japanese are Asian kids. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if he did. And then he says, And then I saved up money in case Raja ever needs a lawyer. He said that, yes, he did. Yeah, yeah, he said that like two weeks ago. My god, man, he did say that. He, dude, he's this is what I don't understand. When Brooke, uh, when Hulk Hogan died, he did a video saying, I met Hulk Hogan a few times, but I remember his daughter was a big bitch, and I wanted to bust his daughter out. Okay, that was unnecessary, but that's the language of heat, though, as well. Like, he's a heel, he knows he's a heel. MMA and pro wrestling are not too far off from one another when it comes to you need a face and a heel. I mean, to be honest with you, right? It's, I mean, it's everywhere, right? Even on streaming platforms like Kick. You know, everyone needs a face and a heel now in streaming. I mean, we've had that since the days of like, you remember when they had blood sport debates? Well, I was talking about sports. You know, I wrote something about this, and that was one of the things I talked about: kind of generating heat is so important. And the beer can is kind of the ultimate heat because whether or not if it's set up or not, that doesn't matter. What matters is when that happens on camera, everybody has to talk about it. Yeah. Because it's something that most people don't get to see. And there's heat in the left podcast world. You know, what do we call shows like The Vanguard? That's literally just people looking to start podcast drama for heat. Yeah. I mean, dude, you know what I was saying? It's a debate, bro. Shit, in a different form. You know what? You've got someone who's got a platform, whether it's left, right, in the center, whatever the fuck. And what do they do that they know will generate views and clicks? They bring in someone that is diametrically opposed to everything this hoax stands for. Why do we think fucking, you know, like guys like Hassan Piker make the rounds? Oh my God. You know, that's like to me, I don't know if you guys agree. That's that's kind of like Kayfabe King. You know, he's, he is, he's the heel. He's the rock. He stone cold Steve Austin for a generation of people that got stuffed in lockers. Yeah. So it for me, a lot of this shit is just pro-wrestling. And that's why I thought this was an interesting thing to talk about. By the way, the culture is very similar too. I actually, you know, I was like kind of saying I have issues with the pro-wrestling culture, but like streaming may actually be worse. Dude, the way. people wait for you to not say a thing and then we got to do a whole stream on the thing that look and it's just outrageous heat also is outrageous and i write about this in the piece when rowdy roddy piper is working for nwa in la and he wants to apologize for all the racist things he says he gets in the middle of the ring before the match even starts and says and this majority mexican crowd he goes i want to apologize i want to sing the mexican national anthem and he brought out his bagpipes he starts playing lakukaracha chairs filled the ring and people came after him trying to kill him the promoters behind it were like this is the greatest thing he could have ever done he's got so much heat we're gonna sell out for the next three months that's the that's how that world works the world we're in is no different the problem is that's entertainment and people are selling their shit on our world as politics and that's where i have the problem yeah well i just meant like culturally streamers get up to a lot of like shady crap i mean you see all the stuff with destiny now and just i mean is that a pun songpiker's mafia yeah i'll tell you what you know, props to Hassan. I knew girls in my college that love that dude. Like, and they they were like, these women were dimes. They were like, I don't know what it is about him because he's an attractive man that's in great shape. Yeah. I mean, he always struck me as like just a nerd, but damn. I mean, he is a fucking nerd. I mean, he's here's the thing that kills me about Hassan Piker, right? Especially considering, you know, Jason and I are in our 40s and had kind of been in the left spaces for the majority of our adult, you know, lifetime. Learning about, you know, actual leftism and activism and organizing and shit like that. Hassan Piker, who literally was born on third, you know, like his career-wise, he was born on third base, you know, but he likes to say he hit a fucking home run. It's like, dude, no, you fucking didn't. Right? Your uncle sacrificed bunnied you into fucking Mahoming, right? You know, but he becomes like the voice of leftism. I was like, okay, dude, what I can tell is you've read stuff. And like, it almost hurts to say this, but you have the Ben Shapiro stick. You talk fast about things you kind of glossed over and remember, and people eat it up. I mean, he's being pushed. I mean, back to wrestling. If you really want to make it back to wrestling, there's a push. I feel. Podbean, your message amplified. Ready to share your message with the world? Start your podcast journey with Podbean.

People really believe that this last election was lost because of not being able to relate to a certain podcast sphere. So, Cat, he's the only cat that does really kind of exist in a podcast world successfully. You know, you can go on majority report if you want to, but it's not hitting as many people as a song is. No. You know, and it's not, that's no shade to salmon them. But the point is, there seems to be a push much larger than just streamers that want to get him in the New York Times. Oh, dude, yeah. And that's the thing. Like, they claim the, you know, the left. And come on, I'm going to go ahead and do this motion towards Rat.

Yeah. You're not kidding, Dizzle. He is a good-looking dude and he's left of center, right? But they think we need an equivalent. We really do not need an equivalent. You really don't. But then that's that Kayfabe, though? Isn't that wrestling? To be fair, I think this I'll say this: at least Asan seems to have a head on his shoulders in a way. Some people, some of the people in that streaming world are very manipulative, bitter, paranoid, sex pest. I mean, like I said, I was being hard on the wrestling world, but the streaming world, there's a lot of parallels where you'll just meet people that are extremely manipulative, rip people off, do all kinds of shady stuff. I mean, it's there's a lot of stunted, emotional, like emotionally stunted people in that world. The Sean King stories I heard about that guy from people that actually worked for him were pretty horrible. Like, like personal stories I heard from people in that world. Look, I've met him briefly. He's like the rock. He's not going to say the wrong thing. He's good at what he's good at, but it's all K Fabe. And that's why, again, that's why I think this story is so interesting. And I want to try to cover it in a different way where we're not just constantly breaking down the punches in 23 and why didn't this guy do this? And it's whatever happens with this, if hopefully Stu is up, his faculties are there, and he can keep, if not wrestling, fucking drive a truck. He can do something with his life and isn't on, you know, needing medical assistance forever. And if that's the case, they're definitely going to spin this. And maybe Raja Jackson gets into pro wrestling with a hell of a story that's bigger than his dad. The LA Times covered this story. You know what the picture was, Mac? Rampage Jackson winning a fucking MMA match. I'm not surprised. I mean, dude, Newsweek covered it. WAPO covered it. You know, like the large names and print media that we used to think were real journalism and now it's just kind of like clickbait shit. You know, they all covered it. That's where I read it first, man. I was like, what in the actual fuck is going on? Right? Like, like I said, they kept saying, you know, professional MMA fighter Raja Jackson, son of Rampage Jackson. And I'm like, I didn't even know he was like active and competitive. You know, like, I knew Rampage had a fuck ton of kids. I'm aware, right? I didn't know any of them were following in dad's footsteps. You know, apparently he hasn't done so very well, though. Like, the whole again, I don't know if it's a blind spot for you guys, but when he takes dude down, Stu is going along with the bid. He knows what's up. They've discussed this. I'm going to take you down. Maybe not how, but he knows dude's going to come in the ring because he's going along with it. But when he slams him, that wasn't a wrestling slam. Yeah. And I would question: has this dude ever done any work whatsoever? And we don't know. We honestly don't know. And maybe we'll never know because of the world that this happens in. Did he come a day before and give some quick training on how not to break someone's neck? He knows how to hurt people, but he doesn't know how to not hurt people. That's a very different art form.

Like, if you know wrestling, you know, half of what these wrestlers do is to make sure I don't hurt or lead to an injury of the person I'm wrestling, right? Like, you may not catch it until they do like the slow mo, but when they're like running, start, hit the opposite ropes, jump over the ropes onto their opponent. What is their opponent doing? Right? They got their arms out ready to catch them. Yeah. You know, and then they know how to roll with it. You know, that takes time to develop, man. Right? Like, running into a ring and the way he picked up Psychos 2 and put him down, I was like, fuck. He put that man down on his head. And I think dude was out when he hit the canvas. Do you agree, JG, that he was out when he hit the canvas? Yeah, yeah, I do. It's funny because I'm trying to think of incidents that were comparable to this. And there's nothing really like I can think of offhand. Two that I can think of, and I don't. I mean, there's the Saturn incident with uh, you know, it happened on an episode of WWE Velocity, one of their C shows, where you know, this jobber wrestler hit Perry Saturn and you know, botched. And Saturn just got really mad and just started hitting him with like a flurry of punches and kicks, so much so that they had to get the jobber out of the ring. And that was a big deal at the time because he like hurt the dude. Yeah, yeah, they were able to finish the match, but you know, yeah, Perry Saturn's not the guy I want I'd want to botch anything with. Uh, that guy, I think he hit Saturn, and Saturn just got really mad that he hit him for real. Like, there's people that are mentioning New Jack, and I think for me, I was talking to JG about this last night again. Uh, Mac, I don't know if you remember New Jack, he was in ECW. New Jack, after his kind of quote-unquote fall from grace, um, was doing low brow promotions in hotel ballrooms. And there was a promotion where this young kid who was under 18, he had lied about his age, had a bit with a little person, and he called himself Mass Transit and wore a bus driver uh uniform. This was not during his fall from grace. There was no one in that ring. That wasn't an ECW. Oh, it was an ECW promotion. Yeah, it was. Oh, it was an ECW. I think it was like a small house show or something. It was small. I think, I think uh Rob RF Video was probably filming it because they had the fan cam deal going on with uh Heyman. Well, one of that's inside baseball, sorry. But one of the things that happened in that, right, is that the that gets him off from a from a an assault charge because I believe the the kid's parents wanted to press charges, and then the wrestling promotion got in trouble because he was under 18. They claimed they didn't know he lied. I could see a kid lying about his age, he wouldn't be the first kid to do that. Um, but uh, I almost called him Rampage Jackson. Uh, New Jack took out a blade and just started cutting this kid because the kid goes, I want to bleed, and he like annoyed him. And well, he annoyed him because he didn't know how to blade, and that's when the light bulb went off. And he's like, Oh, I'm not justifying anything New Jack did. Oh, dude, that kid. Well, the kid ended up killing himself not too long after. A few years ago, no, it wasn't not too long, it was a few years after. Also, but you know what? I always found interesting about that story. There were wrestlers saying that he was on like a stretcher and he tried to jump off the stretcher and was like, Do I have a job now? Well, he the I don't know what's real and what's not, though, because the little person that was in the that was it that was his partner with the whole thing. He says that he agreed to say that it was all planned out. And New Jack said, I'll get you. He's like, Only thing I want to agree to go along with you on this is you get me in the WWE. And that guy got in the WWE eventually. Um, uh, New Jack says the dad called him the N-word. Um, and Paul Heyman, is that his name? The guy that promoted ECW he testified as well to hearing all these racial slurs, and that becomes part of the court case and the settlement to get the wrestling promotion out from under, you know, a lot of trouble that they couldn't afford. But that's my whole thing about shoots and works. Like, you're going to find a way to work this thing because no one wants to pay for the lawyers. Yeah. And not that ECW could do it at the time anyway. I mean, fuck, Paul Heyman owned and ran it and had such a good relationship. You know, I mean, fuck. We found out during the Vince McMahon documentary on Netflix, he was floating Heyman millions of dollars to keep ECW floating. You know, like, you know, it's just, you know, this is the thing, man. Like, professional wrestling is something you have to train and train and continue to do to become proficient at it. I'm not saying good, proficient. If you are not proficient, you have no business doing any of that shit. I'm sorry.

Oshi shouldn't have been in that ring. Yes, exactly. I mean, the other thing with all of this, by the way, the reason I sort of brought in the streaming stuff is, you know, Scott Levy, Raven, the ECW and WCW wrestler, Raven, once said, you know, he thinks that there is something wrong with all wrestlers. Because you have to be a pretty weird person and have to be broken inside on some level to want to perform like that. Yeah, like that, though. What's weird, though, is what he's getting at is like wrestlers have an ego. And I think that's true with streamers, too. Or anyone in the entertainment industry. And that can lead to like really volatile situations. You're dealing with people with huge, massive egos. With massive egos. And the only way that you know that you're going to break through isn't talent, but heat. Not quality. I would argue it can take talent to get heat. No. You can be really trash. You could also be really good at getting heat, though. It can be a talent. Maybe not always. I don't know. I don't really look at controversy as a talent. Well, in a wrestling context. In a wrestling context, that's different. It is because if you're able, like Dominic Mysterio right now has an amazing talent at getting people to hate him. He is probably the best in WWE at it right now. I mean, as a wrestler, you do have to tap into people's psychology. Yeah. You have to tap into the mass psychology of the crowd and get people to either hate you or love you. I mean, there is an aspect of that that, I mean, you have to know what you're doing in order to be able to tap into that. Like, again, I think the wrestling aspect is a little different because it's all about following a trend in this world. You see what's trending and then you talk about it. You don't create the trend. Whereas a guy like New Jack, and I think he's fascinating, a fascinating case study of when he goes wrong and you become the guy. New Jack's interesting because he's the last of so when my dad was growing up, people think that like the people who watched wrestling are dumb and they didn't know it was fake before McMahon came along. That's all BS. It's hella BS. People knew it was fake. I mean, you can find fake or predetermined, whatever people want to call it. You get what I'm saying. But, you know, there was always that one guy that you said, oh, no, that guy's real, though. For my dad, that was Bruno. When Bruno said we're seeing a match in the civic arena, that's real, right? In Detroit, that would have been the sheik. In other territories, it would have been Abdullah the Butcher, right? Especially with the bad guys. Like, people like Abdullah the Butcher or the Sheik, the original Sheik, you would have looked at them and been like, oh, they're real. Well, they took it to the crowd. They took it to the crowd. But that's that's New Jack is the last of that. New Jack's the last guy where it's like, let's make it real. You know, I mean, he made people believe. He also threw a dude off that scaffolding. Yes. Yeah. XTW show. Yes. That was insane. That's a talk about long receipts. You can say what you want about Rajah fucking Jackson. Nothing is like that throwing a man off of a fucking scaffolding. Yeah. By the grace of someone's God, he's alive. I mean, there is a reason for many, many years. Wrestlers had a notoriously short shelf life. And I'm not just talking about their career, just their life in general. Right? They burned the candle at both ends. You know, they probably used more blow than all of Major League Baseball from the years of 1980 to 88. They used more steroids than Major League Baseball from 80 to like 2005. Yesterday. Yeah, you know, like, you know, like they did. They abused themselves. And I'm not talking about what they did in the ring, right? But a lot of these guys, like, we're kind of seeing a change now, right? Like, these wrestlers know that, you know, kind of like when we talk about high school and college athletes, Jason, like nutrition is a science. How do I eat properly to maintain this level? How do I work out and conduct, you know, physical training without overdoing it? That leads to the small tissue injuries that really plague guys like Triple H towards the end of his career, right? You know, they're more savvy now about the physical stuff. And you see a lot of wrestlers that when, you know, the travel load's a lot lighter now than it used to be, a lot lighter. And when they're not wrestling, they're at home, you know. Can I add something to that? Oh, absolutely, man. Please, I that's the biggest thing with wrestlers. Everyone thinks it's always like the bumps, and the bumps do accumulate over time. But what's what drives a lot of guys in that industry crazy in the past, and this is, I wouldn't say this is an issue for WWE guys now because they fly home now more often. I mean, they make a ton of money in WWE. Yeah, it's just ridiculous the amount of money some of them are making. But like the grind of being on the road constantly and just having no real structure beyond I have to go to this show and do a bunch of spots. You can't explain that to normal people. Like you can, but it's like it won't make sense. That's why it's such an insular world. And you're on the road and you're just bored constantly. Like psychologically, that industry messed a lot of people up. Yeah. Because it's just a very like you're only doing a maybe five, 12 minute match, right? But then you're just on the road again. It's the most people have been saying that about touring. People have been saying that about touring too, because it's also a stunted growth. Like you really don't get to grow. You're a real. No, I think you see that with, you know, if you look at a band like Ministry, you know, there's this great documentary around Ministry called Fix the Ministry movie, where it's them on the road during the 95 tour. And like you understand why Al Jorgensen was doing all the crazy crap he was doing. He's on a bus the whole time. It's like, well, how do I stave off board? And I'm just going to do a lot of drugs. There's a lot of downtime. And these are industries where your bad habits are not only welcomed, but encouraged to a certain degree. In a weird way, it makes you more easily controllable since you can't do it. No one, if you, I don't give a fuck what job you work, especially sales. There's a lot of drugs and sales. It is nothing like when you're in the entertainment industry. You still have to produce in sales. You don't necessarily have to produce in the entertainment industry. Because you can have a job like a tech, and your tech could be a horrible drunk or constantly snoated out of their mind. But as long as everything's in tune, any of your monitors work, nobody gives a shit about their drug problem. Maybe you guys all party together. Maybe he's your connect in shitty places like, I don't know, Bayonne, New Jersey, where you don't know where to find good dope. Fayetteville, North Carolina. Fayetteville, North Carolina.

Even now, you know, where, you know, like you said, WWE stars are making money. You know, they can go home. They can work the partial, you know, the Roman Reigns schedule, right? Um, and honestly, I think that's a good thing, right? Because we can see guys like Roman Reigns, who keep in mind that guys beat cancer like twice. Um, and during the pandemic, when you know, there were nobody at the shows, you know, he was going undergoing radiation therapy while still performing. That's right. Um, you know, he's talking about, yeah, man, I'm getting ready to ramp down. Uh, you know, they can drop me out for some big stuff, but like the days of me being out there every Monday or Friday and all the PLEs and all that stuff, he's like, that's done. You know, he's like, I got kids, you know, he's got a pretty big family, he's made some good money, you know, he wants to, you know, we're seeing these athletes that are making the decision now that I'm not going to do this until I'm fucking 60. I don't have to. You know, guys like Sting and all the old heads before, they did that, so I don't have to now. You know, and I think that's fucking phenomenal. And I also, I, I, I, you know, like the constant travel, which, like you said, their bad habits were kind of.

You know, like, oh, don't worry about him, you know, snorting a whole fucking pile of cocaine and downing four bottles of whiskey. Uh, the show's not till eight o'clock tomorrow night, he'll be good to go then, you know. Like, um, you know, and he's gonna be all right, he'll be fine, he'll be fine. He'll take about a 40-minute nap prior to uh, we'll get him in his boots, he'll be good to go. Um, you know, but like that kind of bad behavior, that that hedonistic behavior, you know, like you said, like JG said, that was used to kind of keep them there. Like, hey, man, I know you want more money, but guess what? I got a plug, I'll constantly keep you fed. I just need you to get the show. Do you think it's also like what's that movie? The hurt locker at the end? I'm not trying to say it's a great movie, but at the end of the hurt locker, where dude's in the grocery store and he just feels out of place. Like, I can honestly attest to coming off of a six-month run straight and being like, This is unbelievably boring, even though my life in that van was boring because I'm driving for eight hours, waiting for four hours to play for 35 minutes and then do it again tomorrow. I mean, there might be something to that, but see, what I hated about the end of that movie was like it really played into like the whole PTSD thing, and like you know, it's more understood now, but people don't like they hear PTSD and immediately think you're gonna like go fucking postal. No, my it's like my PTSD just feeds into my depression to where I can't move for like a week, you know. Like, yeah, I wasn't, I wasn't trying to talk about the PTSD angle, no, but like, no, I get that kind of like going back to normal life, yeah, I can definitely see that probably in JG, you know, feel free to hop in here. I think up and towards like the attitude, like the end of the attitude era, like maybe wrestlers had that, but we saw kind of like when we're getting into the PG era, um, where you know, it's become like wrestling's okay for people to like, guys started making more money, you know, they're not traveling as much compared to you know the years prior, not like it is now, you know, but like I get that, I could definitely see that, especially when your normal has become this thing. Um, where, like, in my case, you know, my normal was running around avoiding IEDs and shooting people that were trying to shoot me, right? And when you come home, like, and I'm gonna, I'll be totally honest with you, that is the greatest adrenaline, adrenaline rush of all time. There is no such thing as an adrenaline rush as good as you know, a fucking firefight, man. Yeah, you know, I guess that's what I'm talking about. The thing is, you you fall into two camps where, like, me, I'm bummed because it's not there, right? I can't get it, but you know, this sucks, and I didn't know how to function, or you had the opposite where guys chased it trying to replicate it that adrenaline dump and then doing something very stupid, you know. I was going to say, too. I mean, I a lot of people want to make up sort of like these sob stories for the wrestling world, and I get why, because it is a hard life, but in a way, I almost feel like that disrespects people in that industry in a weird way. Because, I mean, listen, everyone knows that show on Vice, Dark Side of the Ring, right? You're never going to see a Dark Side of the Ring on someone like Nick Bockwinkle, who was a big draw in the regional days in AWA. But Nick Bockwinkle was like, you know, he was like a strict Catholic dude, trained all the time, knew how to cut a promo. I mean, people like Daniel Bryan were influenced by Bockwinkle. If you listen to a lot of wrestlers, they'll tell you about Nick Bockwinkle, even though he's not that well known today. But there's not a story, a dark side of the ring story to tell about him because he had like certain virtues that he upheld. And, you know, I just did a show on Jim Londos, a wrestler from the 30s who was huge. He was Hogan before Hogan. But this is a guy that didn't drink. He, you know, he had a very set regimen for how he approached life. Bockwinkle, I think, was the same way. And I guess what annoys me about the industry is there's guys like that. And then there's a lot of guys that I don't want to sound like a weirdo conservative dude, like lamenting the decline of civilization, but some people, well, no, there's just a lot of people in that industry that I think lack virtue from my experience. And I just, I think that's also one of the big problems. You know, they, you know, someone like Raja, too, I think, you know, I think Raj is almost a failure of society in a way. I think this is a kid that, you know, probably did not have much guidance in life. It's a very cutthroat industry. Raja got fucked because he ends up with Rampage Jackson as a dad. That's just running around calling him a bitch at like 18 months old. He's not responsible for his action, but I do think he could have gone on a different trajectory. And I do think like the combat sports world has like really weird concepts of how the world works at times. And it doesn't bad, it can be self-destructive to the guys involved. Because I would like to know, again, you can watch something a million times. It becomes like the Cam Newton fumble. Yeah. And all you people do is love to be like, why didn't you drop on it? And when you watch it, when I watched it in real time, I didn't think he was a bitch. I thought he did like most people do. Sometimes you have a different reaction. His reaction is like, oh, and then it was too late. That was his reaction, right? Do you think he was a bitch, Mac? No. I mean, dude, that guy spent the best years of his life just being crushed. Are you a contractor, restaurant owner, retail store, garage or manufacturer? If you'd like to save money on your commercial insurance, there is only one name in town. Who is it?

Calls today for a commercial quote on your business. 570-323-3600. That's 570-323-3600. Call today. All right. Like, I will never call Cam Newton a bitch. Especially the beatings that he took, you know, kind of fed into his arm fall, you know, essentially ceasing to work properly. Um, you know, so I'm not going to call Cam Newton a bitch. I'm not going to call those guys bitches. Okay. Because here's the thing. I don't play professional football, okay? I don't. I'm not a professional wrestler. Did I box professionally? Yes, but you know what? Not a fast sport, dude. And on top of that, I don't have a guy that's 300 fucking pounds running at me at like 20 miles per hour trying to hit me. Okay, like who am I to call any of those guys a bitch? You know, do I get flustered when they dropped a beautifully dropped pass? Yes, yes, I do. I get angry, okay? But am I gonna call him a bitch? No, because you know what he's doing? He's making $110 bajillion dollars to play at the pinnacle of his sport. Like, yeah, I'm gonna call him a bitch, man. Fuck you. Okay, because he may not hit me, but that guy he pays to watch his back with the 110 bajillion dollars he makes will and feel real good about it. Okay, we'll go to jail for it because he knows he's gonna get a bag when he comes out. Oh, dude, he he's gonna come back to a bag, a Rolex, and probably a new car. Yeah, you know, like that's the self-preservation part of me. And the other part is I just respect an athlete for what they do, right? Like, I would never, okay. Like, I have when I went to a Wrestling Wars Carolina show, they're like, You're stocky, dude. We need some stocky guys. You look like you're pretty strong. Do you want to come to school? Absolutely fucking not, dude. I am 40 years old. You throw me on my back twice, I'm not getting up. I can't do this. I am man enough to say that. I was like, I will watch each and every one of you guys go and do it. I'm going to be loud. I'm going to be. Well, Timothy, how many bajillion is that per week? It's one quarter three jillion a week, okay? Virtuously, yes. Cam Newton is a massive mouth of a man. He's a large man. You know, but like, I'm not going to sit here. Like, I couldn't do what they do. And I think it's really disingenuous when you get people behind a microphone or through the anonymity of the internet that run around calling these guys bitches, ignoring the hard work, the sacrifice, and the dedication it takes to get to that level. And I think the same way about professional wrestlers. No, I think that's true. Yeah. You know? No, I think that's a very valid point. In the end, it's hard to talk about because when I talk about pro-wrestling, I often sound way too critical to some people, but I also have a lot of respect for people in the industry. I haven't.

Ton of respect, you know, doing the Kayfabe thing and digging into wrestling as an angle. Uh, I never, I always had respect for people that did it because for the same reasons that Max said, but kind of digging more deeper into it, into the history, how K-Fabe works. Um, I just, I, I, I think I look at them a little bit differently. Uh, I do look at them as athletes more so than I did before. Um, I worked now, Jason, because so many of them were collegiate athletes, you know, and I'm not even just talking about in the big leagues. A lot of these wrestlers that are on the independent scene were people that were like D2, D3 athletes. Dude, a guy I went to school with at Pembroke is touring with Ring Wars Carolina right now. He played, he was a he was a collegiate wrestler, you know. I mean, and that's the thing. They are all athletes now. This isn't the days where, like, fuck earthquake, right? Like, he was just a big fat guy, right? You know, and I'm not trying to be disrespectful to this man. I'm not, but that's who he was. He didn't move well in the ring, you know. He didn't, you know, he's not like, he weighs the same as Jacob Fatu does now. And Jacob Fatu is a psycho, crazy good in that ring. The shit he does for a man his size is insane, right? Drew McIntyre, fuck. That, you know, what, JG, what's his announced weight? Like, they say he's 275. That guy is easily pushing 300 pounds and maybe has 10% body fat. Maybe. And the shit a man his size can do is nuts. Right. You know, these, these performers, these, these wrestlers, these sports entertainers, whatever the fuck you want to call them, are phenomenal athletes now. Well, let me ask you guys this question as we get ready to wrap up. Is this the future? For smaller promotions? It doesn't cost a lot of money to get yourself a professional fighter. I hate to say there are dime and dozen, but there's a lot more people that have fought professionally, especially in MMA. As my friend Burt Cooper says, there's a lot of people. Jason, Mark Wayne Mullins, a representative from the state of Oklahoma, was a professional fighter. And I'll leave it at that. So I don't know. You know, I sometimes wonder if the direction is more getting celebrities involved. You know, that actor, Paul Walter Hauser, is a wrestler now. And he's like an award-winning actor. I mean, it's a character, Walter Hauser. I mean, JG, they just had Jelly Roll at SummerSlam, dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that's because he's in one of the smaller promotions. MLW. Well, MLW is bigger than a lot of the smaller promotions. Bigger than most, smaller than others. Yeah. Cindy Lopper and MTV were involved with, I think, the first wrestling. Yeah, and that was because they were looking to branch out into MTV. So that's smart, you know, marketing center. I say that to say that there's always been celebrities. Mr. T. But see, now it's not just like fucking, you know, they pop up, some heat gets generated, and then it's a one-off. Like Jelly Roll was on TV for a month and a half, right? You know, with Randy Orton. I mean, fuck, you know, like him or not, and we all know that I hate both of them. Logan Paul. Yeah. Right? If Dom Mysterio is the top heel at this moment, Logan Paul's number two easily. Right? They're putting Kay Fabe into action in real life in a way that we're not ready for because Donald Trump, it took him a while to really get it. These kids were born into it and they scare me. They legitimately frighten me. And I'm not saying this to be facetious or funny. They legitimately frighten me. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I just want you to know I appreciate you saying Logan Paul, right? I thought Jake was the boxer in quotes. Can I? I wanted to go back to something I was saying because I felt like it wasn't worded very well when I was talking about virtue and lack of virtue in certain cultures. You know, right after the incident happened with Raja, he's walking outside on his kick stream saying, I ain't no bitch. I ain't no bitch. I'm going to stand up for myself. I mean, basically, he's mistaking his uncontrolled violence for self-respect. And oh, I was just saying, it wasn't about self-respect. He engaged in an act of uncontrolled violence, right? Yeah. And I think this ties into like the sort of toxic, I hate that word toxic masculinity, but like this is a dude whose dad hangs out with Sneeko, you know, an Andrew Tate acolyte. And there's this whole problem, I think, with Andrew Tate peddling this idea of masculinity, where masculinity means are you able to dominate other people and get a lot of wealth and materialism? And that's, I'm not sure that's what makes a man. I don't think it's what makes a man. And I think it's an immature way to understand what masculinity and manhood are. And, you know, because self-control is just as much a part of being a man, right? And I think that's what we lack today in the sort of combat sports world in a lot of ways. It's, I mean, there's a lot of like just dark sort of uh these really just I would say counterfeit ideas of masculinity that well would you say would you say and and this is probably gonna give me a lot of trouble and I'm trying to please if you're a professional fighter see me on the street I'm not trying to see anybody's hands I will hit you with bottles or a firearm no he won't what he'll do is run as fast as his feet can take him I will hit someone with anything I can find so he can run yeah I'm not gonna stick around and talk I mean that's not how you that's how you live another day that's how do you think Jason's picked up running while he's been down in Mexico you hit someone with a bottle and take off you look for the exit where's Jason turns around he's like you bitch um maybe forget what I was gonna say uh but does it feel a little fashy to you though oh and the idealism of manhood, JG, Mike yeah or and I I just think it's a weird view of manhood. I mean, you know, it's like even when people talk about toughness, you know, everyone talks about toughness in terms of being like physically tough. Okay, you win a fight. But there's such a thing as mental toughness that matters too in life. You know, and I don't think Roger Jackson showed mental toughness. I mean, he allowed people to rage bait him into a fury, and then he got into a ring and you know, assaulted a guy. If that's the case, if that's the case that this kid was raged into what happened, that's a scary world we live in. No, it is. Everything is rage. I mean, but we've already seen shit like this, Jason. You know, we've seen videos like this. We've watched him. You know, there's always an altercation. And what do you see? What do you immediately see? Four of these two dickheads' friends behind him. You know, just like, yo, Derek, fucking just hit him, dude. Fucking hit him, bro. And Derek's just like, hey, man, if you if you don't knock it off, I'm gonna, I'm gonna hit you, dude. Derek, just fucking blast him. You know, like, but but again, if let's just say this happens 40 years ago, same situation, son of a fighter, small-time promotion, but no one has a camera in their pocket, and there we don't know what social media is. Does the same thing happen, or does the fact that the world is witnessing have a bigger influence than even the people calling him names? Because that's part of that's that's a question for like a wrestling historian like Dave Meltzer, who would be able to like cite an incident like that for 40 years. I mean, but I mean, JG, like, if like, correct me if I'm wrong, but like the thing is, they would have you would have had people, probably some of those more illicit types that were promoters at the time, separate them and just immediately go, How do we turn this into an actual cash revenue? I'll tell you this: I know a lot of wrestlers that were very upset when this happened because particularly the wrestlers from the California scene that said specifically to me, if that would have happened at one of our shows, like the locker room would have been down there in seconds to just like do something about it. Like the moment he slammed him, you think? Yeah, yeah, there's still a moment where you look at. Do you guys want to? Is this bad if we watch it? I mean, everybody in chat's already seen it. So no, they have not. This is a fucking lefty show. I mean, it wasn't. I'm, yeah, dude. I would.

Really surprised that the locker room didn't immediately go out when they saw fucking Psycho's head bounce off the mat, right? Like, yeah, because that's happened at shows before where guys race down to the ring, you know, like a fan jumps in and they get their asses kicked, yeah, dude. You know, like it's it goes back to what I was saying, though. Like, if you're not trained in this, don't do it, man. Just don't. Um, because you could, you know, you could fuck somebody up pretty bad, man. Um, you know, it's just, I don't know. That's weird, Jason. Is I almost wish I believed what you believed, where it like literally was this intricately planned out work. But I, I, because that's like more comforting than the idea that, wow, the level of incompetence on display here and lack of foresight. Yeah. And the thing is, JG, it's like on every level, too. It's not every level. It's not. If you're sorry to cut you off, if you are Raja's people and you stayed, you are culpable because you have one job if you are his manager, quote unquote. I mean, listen, Kick just had an issue with like a guy literally dying on stream who'd been bullied, okay, from France. I mean, I'm not sure kick managers are the most uh scrupulous people. Yeah, I mean, and it's a kick manager. I'm assuming that was someone involved with kick. I don't know. It's not just manager, whether it's like his personal or kick, right? It's the promoter. It's um psycho who decides, okay, I'm gonna throw a beer can at someone who's not really initiated into this business, right? Like, there was a failure on every single level that I think that people more important than us three on this stream right now aren't really talking about enough, you know? Like, I get, especially as a small promotion, we want to get our name out there. There's a new streaming thing. Maybe we can get our shows on kick. Yeah. How can we do that? I understand that line of thought. Okay. What I do not understand, though, is if this is your promotion and it's something that you're actually trying to get off the ground and gain traction, and maybe you become like the next, you know, coming of ECW, right? Like you were this, this kind of like forgotten entity, you know, and you pulled yourself up by your bootstraps and, you know, you got important enough to where more important entity bought you out, right? But this isn't how you do it, right? Like this is not how you do it. And the fact that promoters or business managers on every level weren't just like, guys, this is stupid as shit. And this might actually cost us in the long run. Maybe that's the future. I don't think that's the future. I think if Stu is able to walk, the future is more, let's get more people that we can't control into a situation like this because this is great heat. Everybody's talking about us. We're in every national news. I watched the big LA news channel did a thing about this because it was so crazy. Here's the incident in question. Okay, hold on. I have to mute it because if we play mute. The man who stopped Roger Jackson's brutal assault on the incident. What actually happened on the street? Broken facial bones is from what I'm hearing. Missing teeth has no recollection of what happened. Incoherent. And there was other people that could have gotten involved, but they just stayed by the stage. Let me put it this way. I'm sorry to Stu, that the people that said that they were your friends let this happen. I just got done with sorry about that. We have to because the music that plays, yeah, so this is where the guy is telling them, um, you're gonna sell it, you're gonna sell it, and then he apologizes to him, and then Dew says it's all good. But how many hours later was it that they actually got into the fight after this? It was like three or four, wasn't it, JG? Before the you know, post-beer can, before the head being folded into the mat, yes, you know, like so, it's not like he got hit with the can and then psycho Stew went in to you know do his match and then he immediately came out, right? Like, so there was something was going on. This is where it's like, okay, you hurt that man, yeah, right, you hurt that man, like bad when he did that. Yeah, go ahead. Listen, I, you know, I get where you're coming from, Jason. Like, oh, this could become the new thing, but I do think there's probably a line that was crossed for wrestlers with this. So, what I mean is that there's this wrestler, uh, Joey Ryan, right, who's trying to make a comeback now after having like 16 sexual assault allegations against him, right? Um, he's been gone from the industry for five years, uh, he's trying to make a comeback, it's not working, okay. Now, in wrestling, a lot of sexual assault allegations are just swept under the rug. They're like, oh, it was a rat or a groupie, we don't really care, and that's horrible to me. But with Joey Ryan, he's remained blackballed. And there's a reason for that. He wasn't going with outsiders and doing this. He was doing with people in the industry. Now, I think it's bad whether you're an outsider or not, but since he has sexual assault allegations against him by women talent, you don't mess with the talent. You don't mess with the brotherhood. You don't mess with people in the industry. And wrestlers take that very seriously. It's like you don't mess with the fellow Carney people. That's why I don't think you'll be seeing Raja picked up. I hope that makes sense. I mean, it's a very small world. You think he's kind of tainted goods? Pro wrestlers are not going to want to deal with him. Shout out to Daniel Shine for watching the show. Shout out, guys. I can say workers are, in fact, very angry about all of this. Yeah. I could see that. It's similar with Joey Ryan thing. Like, you don't mess with people in the industry. You're putting people's lives in jeopardy with people that don't know how to take a bump. And when you slam a man down on his head, he's not playing anymore. And you don't get it. Again, I don't know if he came a day before and rolled a little bit. And they're like, okay, this is how you do it. Don't, you know how you normally do it? You can't do it like that because you're going to kill one mate. Okay. I'm starting to believe more, not believe, but I'm starting to kind of fall in line more with you, JG. That I think it's a thing that happened that quickly got turned into a work that tragically got turned into a shoot, but even more tragically will be turned into some sort of work. Yeah, because that's just how that's just how the world, that's how the world works. Yeah, but like, I don't, the thing is, it's like JG was saying, this is a very insular community, right? Whether you're in the big leagues or at a show or working for a promotion that only draws 10 people every show, right? There's a certain fuck. I did, there's a certain sanctity to what they do. This is going to sound bad, but like, it's almost like a cult in the where you're allowed to, in wrestling, I hate to put it this way, but you're allowed to mess with everyone outside of the business, people who aren't workers. But once you mess with someone inside it, then you have a bullseye on your back. You don't, you don't, there's a line you don't cross. Yeah, I mean, dude, we fucking see him every day. They have podcasts. Yeah. Right? Guys like Ryback. Nobody wants to work with that fucker now. Nobody. Daniel says, once he shook Stu's, I'm agreeing with you, Daniel. Once he shook Stu's hand, that was buried, getting riled up by a bunch of 12-year-olds calling him a pussy is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen. It was attempted murder. I really, really hope that's not what it was and dude was just trying to play a role very badly. But I'm going to say this one more fucking time, right? Sure. Training is everything. Yes. It doesn't matter what you're doing, right? You could literally be editing the written word. There's training that goes into that. So you do it well. Yes. So you make sure that that author or that writer's best work is getting out there, that you're presenting that worker, you know, that writer's work in the best possible light, right? If you don't have training, you don't need to be doing that thing, right? And coming in the day before or the week before, or even the month before, you are not prepped, right? You are not prepped to go out and do this, right? And you could tell by the way he picked up Psycho Stu, like he wasn't prepped to put him down in such a way where Stu was ready to take that bump, right? His head was all the way back. You know, he dropped him on his fucking head and out of shoulder blades. You know, like this was. He dumped him like it was a fight. Yeah. I agree with my friend in the chat, Fleshwound Dan. High. I agree. Even if you don't understand wrestling, any sane person realizes over 20 punches to an unconscious man's face and killed him. Yeah. But I think, again, that goes back to like, look, I feel like Rosh is a person that has never had.

Push back extremely hard on that and say, I've seen people fall off, uh, jump off willingly two-story roofs onto tables. I don't know what people are capable and want to do and what they do and bounce back up on, especially if I'm not in that world. Yeah, but we've also seen you and I grew up in some rough and tumble areas where we've seen a dude disappear for months at a time because they took shots of the face like that, you know. Like, I mean, we've seen people get paralyzed on the football fields from hits that didn't seem super violent. So, say jumping off of a you know, the scaffolding. I mean, Prairie, I think Prairie put it best: the first time I boxed and took a headblow, I was rattled. I could hear my ancestors, they spoke Polish, so I think they wanted me to stay away from Catholic women. But regardless, I gave up boxing. That's good. I mean, he's not wrong, and that's when I tell people, like, they're like, Hey, man, I want to get into boxing, like, it'll help my, like, my cardio and strength train and my core. And I'm like, Yeah, that's all well and good. How do you feel about getting hit in the head? Multiple times. First thing everyone looks, you know, as well as I know, Mac. If you're in a boxing gym, even a fitness boxing gym, that might have a couple of guys that know how to throw hands, they're gonna walk up to the dude on the bag. Hey, you uh, throw some real good punches. You know, that step in the ring with me for a little bit. You want to spar, bro? You want to spar? I just want to reiterate something real quick. The thing that gets me about all this with Raja is like that interview from two weeks ago with that I mentioned with Rampage Jackson, where he's like, I saved up money for my Japanese kids to go to college and I saved up money so that Raja can have a lawyer when he does something horrible, which he will do. I'm just like, no wonder this kid is like disconnected from reality. Yeah. I mean, I hate to put it that way. Like, I don't feel bad for Raja Jackson in the sense that, like, I think he's responsible for his actions, but I'm like, this, this is like a kid that was set up to be disconnected from reality in a weird way. I mean, he lives on a kick stream, you know, and something was bound to happen. And you know what's weird? Like, the fact that Rampage didn't take that seriously and would say something like that. Like, oh, I'm learning up from a kid in advance. Yeah, you know, like, I just, I feel like his trajectory was set. This should also be a lesson to just anybody because, again, I think a lot of this heat, Kfababe, all these terminologies, I think, really equate to the real world we live in as well. And people are constantly trying to generate heat in online spaces. And if you are reading Twitter, God forbid you say anything that someone wants to talk about, but you're going to have a skewed view of the world if that's your only outlet to it. Or a major outlet to it. I shouldn't say your only, but a major outlet to people outside of your immediate social circle. And depending on how small your social circle is, your real life one, and you think this is really how people act, how people respond to the things you say on social media, or the arguments that you get into on social media, or chats on shows. Oof. Oof, you're gonna be a volatile individual. I'm gonna tell you right now, hearing my father say, I saved up money for my kids that I sired in Japan, right? You're like, oh, that's nice, Rampage Jackson, good for you, dude. And then he follows it up with, yeah, but Raja, I have a lawyer on permanent retainer for him, right? That's not the support you should be giving your fucking kid, man. Yeah, right? Like, I'm glad I'm not the only one that is thinking about this. Like, it's just sad all the way around. You know what? It's funny. Virtuoso just said, seek therapy. That's the lesson. I've been very critical of therapeutic culture. And I, you know, I think there's abuse that goes on with the therapeutic world as well that people don't like to talk about. But in this case, you know, yes, seek therapy. Yeah. You know, like I just, this entire episode kind of brings that, you know, it shines a light on that dark underbelly of, you know, what Jason and I have talked about a lot. And that's the chronically online culture that we live in now. You know, I understand like the content influencer thing. That's a part of society that we're not getting rid of. It's not going anywhere, right? I agree, Dan. Rampage obviously, New Raja had issues. I agree with that. That's part of the problem. Yeah. Daniel hit the nail on the head with that one. Absolutely. But, like, living on a live stream, right? And having people that don't know you that, you know, are willing to just needle you constantly and shit talk. And they do it from behind the comfort of a keyboard, you know, thousands of miles away. Like, why would you subject yourself to that? Right? Like, Jason, you know what? I do a show, you know, we do Beyond the Red Zone. I get on a couple other streams during the year. You know, I get some shit talking. It's all well and good, man. I don't give a fuck. I don't know you. You don't like me. You know, I don't care. You know? I'm okay with that kind of interaction. But what I would never, ever fucking do is get a kick account and just stream my entire life. That leaves me open to one, that kind of weird parasocial relationship that comes with likes and follows, right? As well as thinking that you have to do something to entertain the masses, so to speak, right? I don't give a fuck if anybody's entertained by me. What I give a fuck is having a great show with you and JG tonight, right? Like, that's it. Outside of that, if you don't like it, don't fucking watch, homie. Kick rocks, suck my dick from the back, and just carry on with your day. Right? Like, and honestly, I don't understand the level of commitment it takes from people to be so invested in someone that you watch them like stream for hours and hours a day. You guys remember that documentary, We Live in Public from 2009? No, vaguely. It was Andy Timminer directed it, but it was about this guy, Josh Harris, who was an internet entrepreneur that lost everything when he did the when the dot-com bubble burst. But he literally lived his life on public before in public before anyone else. It was an art project called Quiet. We live in Public, where he just streamed his entire life. And it's disturbing. Well, I think the whole thing, it was years before all of all of this stuff. That's why I mentioned it. You know, back to the whole kind of like talking about a guy like Hassan Piker thing. The reason why the parasocial thing works is because his life is so public. Every aspect of life is, I don't want to say curated, but kind of thought through. So you can't just live. Yeah. You're constantly brand advertising. You are a brand. And see, here's the thing. My brand would always suck because you know what I like to do every so often now. Granted, I started running again because my brother's like, hey, let's run a marathon next May. And I'm like, fuck it, let's go. So that's the most 40-plus year-I started training, right, running again in addition to weightlifting. And like, you know what I like to do though? I like to go out and get drunk and be silly, right? For a brand, that's bad, unless that's your brand. That's not really my brand. I just like to do it every so often. You know, Google Steam, fucking text Jason about 9 million times after midnight. You know, like, that's what I like to do. Does you know this? This all reminds me of there's this great joke that uh the GOAT comedian Doug Stanhope had, where like someone pulled out a cell phone to record his show while he was doing a stand-up. And he's like, Why do you have your cell phone out? Like, why do you have to like tape everything? Can't you just enjoy a show? Like, you have to put everything on. I need to remember this for the rest of my life. I have to take a video up. I was talking with a friend about that, about you know, how I don't have certain memories because uh, Facebook uh erased my account a few years ago when I wrote something. Um, and that sucks because I'm not the biggest picture taker all the time, and I've gotten worse over the years. So, I just forgot large facets of my life I don't remember. Um, because I don't have any evidence of it. Like, we always kept in modern modernity with the invention of the camera and everything, we kept these keeps.

Fake memories of special moments, birthdays, graduations, family get-togethers. And I agree with you, JG, that we've gone so overboard that every meal, every sunset, every smile has to be captured to the point that it's just not real. And there's always something about the photograph that you knew it wasn't going to be 100% real, right? Like the World War II picture, the We Won, the guy, we think it's a man returning home and kissing his old lady, and it's just a random woman he grabbed, right? So this idea about real and fake. And I talk about it in the thing I just wrote about the idea that reality TV is real. It's always been scripted. Oh, yeah. But we, and the situations are set up. And people come in as characters. Okay, you're going to be the bitch. You're going to be this guy. To be honest, it's even true with like Cinema Verte style documentaries, right? Like, listen, I love a good Frederick Wiseman documentary. You know, if people don't know who Frederick Wiseman is, he did movies like high school and the famous one is the Titicut Follies, where he filmed inside an asylum. But he would film inside asylums and high schools, no narration, and he would just film, right? And then turn it into a documentary, you know. But even when you have a camera on, people act differently. Yes. You know, and that's why Herzog has even said he doesn't like Wiseman's stuff that much because, you know, Warner Herzog says, like, well, you know, you're always like, you're never getting at the pure, pure truth. The only way you get at the pure truth is through the narrative. Whether you agree with him on that or not, the fact is, like, when you turn on a camera, people act differently. You're not, things are even a pure documentary, like one Wiseman does, where there's no narration, you're still seeing things through a lens, whether he is interfering or not, because people act differently on camera. Yeah, I hope that makes sense. But what happens when life is now lived through a lens? And that's my bigger point for this whole thing, bigger than the incident that happened, is we're living life through a lens and what is real for people. Gavin Newsom is doing the exact same thing Donald Trump is doing. That fool called the National Guard to clear out homeless encampments. Oh, yeah, he did. Donald Trump's doing it in DC, but it's a big deal. It's a big deal when both of them do it. Neither one of them really has policy that anyone can put their finger on. One tries to rule through like a king's decree of presidential orders. And the other is just trying to be the other side of some sort of fascist coin where it's just fascism with your pronouns on your jacket lapel. And that's where the Kayfe really kind of have to wake up out of the trance of it because we don't want to fall victim to it. No one wants to be a mark. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. There you go. Thank you. No one wants to be the mark. Maybe that's how I should have ended the pieces. You know, I have to say this. I love that someone brought up Jerry Springer and how people used to think of it. Because you know, that ties into what we're talking about in a weird way. Because you know what made a lot of people realize Jerry Springer was fake? The Iron Sheik was on at one time as a different character. No fucking way. Wait, really? I don't even remember that. I watched it. I played a character on Jerry Springer, and that's when people started saying, hey, wait, that's the Iron Sheik. Well, for me, the whole reason why talk shows are important is because talk shows were what people look at podcasts now today. People were really listening to like Springer's final words as like these words to live by. It's like, wait a minute, times did you witness what the fuck happened for the other 45 minutes? It's not even just that, it's like you forgot what he did in Cincinnati when he was mayor. Not just the city letterhead check to the prostitute, it was the mountains of cocaine that were consumed in the fucking mayor's building. It was him bribing city council people with city funds, you know, like crisis actor was so stupid, you know. It's just, yeah, man, I just maybe it is because I'm old, you know. Um, but the older I've gotten, it's the whole no, you know, no gods, no kings, no masters thing has really just it's something I really stress to my kids. I'm like, I want you guys to enjoy things. Uh, life sucks, find something that you can laugh at or enjoy reading or watching, you know, whatever it is, right? But I was like, do not get so wrapped up in these fucking streamers because at some point they're gonna spout lines of bullshit, at you that have nothing to do with why you're watching the stream to begin with, you know. And it's it's true of almost everything. Dude, we're seeing it, especially in our neck of the woods, Jason, in sports. Yeah, you know, it's it's only gotten worse. With gambling. Yeah. You know, I see it happening in wrestling as we see the further conglomeration of it under one big TKO umbrella as they continue to allow Saudi Arabia to sports wash all their fucking wrongdoing. You know, you know, so it's it's it's everywhere. And honestly, it's it's very unavoidable at this point. But you know, what we have to do is I would like to think smart consumers of media consider this my lesson. And, you know, one of the courses I took in J school was, you know, media literacy. We have to be smart and guard against this kind of stuff. You know, I mean, granted, Marcus did amend the whole no gods, no masters. He also said no podcasters. You know, so it's, it's, it's maybe starting to get to that point. But well, look, when I saw people looking at what other podcasters said and getting mad about it as politics, that's when I was like, that for me was the okay, well, I guess we're all in a state of cafe. That's right. You know, like, and, you know, this is this is something that at a societal level, we're going to have to start tackling, right? Because it's, it's already getting to the point where we may not be able to stuff it back in the box, right? It's this, you know, taking what podcasters or streamers or whatever as like gospel. And, you know, people will bitch at me about this, but I will, I will maintain it. I love our little community here. I think we have some pretty media literate people. But there are large channels far larger than ours that have a lot of people that aren't media literate that watch that make these online communities the society in which they function rather than the one they actually live in. Yeah. And this is what's allowing, for lack of a better term, and I can get into it more like on a special stream or whatever, but this like it's, I call it boomer creep, right? Boomers were the first generation to kind of push away society. It became very Ayn Randian, right? If I look out for myself, my community is going to be fine if we all look out for ourselves. Right. And it's only gotten worse. I mean, Kush, if we get, I'll tell you what, if the things happen and we can bring back those societal levels, Jason and I will start the very first skateboard jousting league. I'd much rather see skateboard jousting than power slap and power kick. Did you see power kick, by the way? I don't want to see power kick. It's a real thing. I don't want to see it. That sounds even worse than power slaps. That's the first thing I thought. It's just stupid. I mean, I have one more thing to add since we mentioned the sports gambling stuff. That ties into all of this, right? Like, I know people that religiously watch, like, what's this? The power's Dave Portnoy or whatever. Oh, dead, dead, dead, dead hole, dead. That dude has convinced me that, like, we're past the point of no return. This is the end of civilization as well. Blarstool Sports. That's the barstool. He's just such a contemptible person. Oh, he's a colossal TWAT, JG. I cannot stand Dave Portnoy. And I hate how he turned making middling content into very lucrative business on his end because he caters to a certain type of sports fan, you know? And then he gets involved in the crypto and the sports gambling now. And it's just like he's everywhere. Why is Dave Portnoy on Fox's college football coverage? Why? He brings nothing. Nothing. How are you going to put him on the same set as Brady Quinn and Urban fucking Meyer? Right. He's another example, like Tate. Going back to what I was like, what I'm annoyed by is, you know, I've had some people defend Rampage Jackson saying, well, you know,

Just wanted to toughen his kid up. That's why he calls him a bitch and all that stuff. I've had people say that to me, like normal normies, you know. But it's like, I think people need a better idea of what toughness is. And I think people need a better idea of what masculinity is. Did your dad ever call you names, JG, to toughen you up? I don't know. I don't know if he ever did. I'm sorry. Your paws scared the shit out of me. Like you went back to a dark place. Yeah. He locked me into, he used to punish me by locking me into a, into like, whatchamacallit? Like the closet. And he would tell me the boogeyman is coming to get me. Oh, man. I probably should not admit this. Was he fucking with you or was this like your punishment? He was fucking with me. Okay. I mean, my dad called me a communist cunt last week. So does that count? Well, you're an adult. If you father see you when you're seven, that's what I'm saying is there really is more to being a there's more to toughness than like can you want to fight and we've lost sight of these values I mean I it's just weird to me I you know how hard it is to care about somebody like I'm being totally serious like you know how tough it is to have a kid get to a certain age and be mad at you because they're mad at themselves and then you have to hear them yell at you and you not hit them like they I usually fight people for things like this child but I mean the reality you know what by the way I'm not like against like people taking drinks I'm not against like people knowing like for instance self-defense I took like taekwondo for years. That's like it's cool to know how to fight and how to protect yourself, but like the lack of a focus on like, well, what do men have to be mentally? What do they have to be to their community that that sort of gets to me. I'm like, there's more to being a man than just like, yeah, whatever Andrew Tate is saying. And I hope people get that out of this. That's my biggest takeaway from all this. Well, as cheese dick as it is, man, I think one of the coolest things I've seen this year is the sheer amount of people. And here's the cheese dick part. After watching the Superman movie, the new one, that's like kindness is cool. You know, being kind is the new punk. I love that shit, man. It doesn't take any money to be kind to people. And that's how I look at it. Oh, man. It's fucking awesome. You know, I like to think I'm good to people until you give me a reason to not be good to you. You know, and it's just like maybe we are too far gone, right? Maybe, maybe Dave Portnoy has ushered that in. But it gives me a bit of hope to see, especially like since I went to college so late and I was around a lot of younger people. I view kindness as the great loop to an attack. God damn it, Chris. That's some like sad, like somebody did something real bad. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. I feel, I've, I feel them on that. Yeah, I do. You know, but like seeing empathy in action and seeing people be kind to people. Like, yeah. It, I can't say it gives me hope because I'll be 44 in November. I don't think anybody, anything can give me hope, but it makes me hopeful, if that makes sense. It's funny you mention that because, so I wrote a whole piece about the Rasha Jackson incident, and I've been shopping it around unsuccessfully, probably because it's too niche and like the conservatives won't like it, and neither will people on the left. But I, I, I sort of said, like, and this is sort of a jab at a lot of conservatives. You know, how a lot of conservatives talk about we need to protect the classics, you know, the story of Odysseus, the epic of Gilgamesh, kids aren't reading the classics anymore. And I sort of said, like, we don't even teach the values of the classics, you know, the classics do teach values, you know. The story of Odysseus teaches the value of temperance and self-control. Gilgamesh teaches about humility. You know, all of these values can be found throughout history and culture, right? And I think we've like lost sight of those values. I sound like a conservative now saying this, but it's weird because the conservatives don't actually care about any of these values. They don't care about the values. Yeah, they talk about the loss of values all the time. But I think what we're really talking about when we think about this incident is no one on this show, I think this episode we've said the word toxic masculinity more than any other episode I can think of that we've done, unless we're using the term because it's so cliched, but it does. It really does exist. If this, again, if this kid is so motivated by these names being called to him, it really does mean that no one's ever taken that cat aside and hugged him when shit like that happens. You've had Ryan Sickraff on, right? Yeah. You know, it's funny. I had Ryan on to talk about like issues facing men and you know the crisis of masculinity stuff. And I had a bunch of people get like really mad about it. People are mad at Ryan right now. Yeah. But I think he's on to something. I don't, I mean, we can't just say, like, oh, pull yourself up by the bootstraps to young men. And there has to be a positive vision of masculinity. And I don't have it. Let's be honest. We don't have it because you know who's giving it to him? The Andrew Tates of the world. Or if you're not Andrew Tate, you're someone that's all about financial success as part of your masculinity. And those are the people that are controlling the narrative about masculinity. And that's a problem. I'm agreeing. Dude, I think we are all in agreeance. Yeah. I don't think any of y'all are bitches. I think it takes balls to do the shows that you do, JG. I think it takes balls for you to be yourself, Matt, considering you came back as a 20-year war veteran. 16. 16. Okay. Sorry. I gave you an extra four, but no, if I had an extra four, I wouldn't be in the financial straits I'm in right now. Oh, you would, if you would have had the extra four, but you don't have the extra four for very good reason, right? Yeah. So my point is that's hard. The struggle to come back and then try to be a dad and trying to be a dad every day is something I fucking respect. That's tough. That's fucking tough. Yeah. And it's just like kind of piggybacking on what you were saying, JG, like toughness isn't a fist or a gun. Yeah. There's nothing tough about that. Like for me, you know, like Jason, you know, I build firearms. Like that's, it's one of the things I really enjoy doing. And I'd like to start a business doing it so leftists can actually feel good about their purchase. But like, I'm not tough when I have a firearm in my hand. That is, that's a tool and it's only used to take life. That's it. And if you're so blasé about taking life, like again, someone didn't pull you aside and hug you when you were a child, right? Like, that is fucking facts. You know, toughness is being able to shrug off people on the internet calling you a bitch and trying to egg you on, or like your buddies, you know, at a gathering. You know, tough is, you know, coming back after a long shift at work, getting your shit together and dadding it up. You know, tough is having an opinion that you're passionate about, you know, that you back up with, you know, faction research in action that people don't like, but you continue to do it. You know, my daughter's got her driving test coming up and she's fucking terrified. And I was like, kid, being brave isn't doing something stupid, like charging two guys with machine guns and just hucking grenades like they were baseballs, which is something I did. You know, I was like, being brave is being put in uncomfortable positions to do something and you do it anyway. That's bravery. I will say there was one moment of valor in this whole story. We have to get kudos again to the epic Doug Mallow coming in and, you know, breaking it up. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's, I mean, I wish it would have happened a little bit sooner, but, you know, I mean, that's the one silver lining maybe in this story. I'm like, oh, God, someone did the right thing. Yeah. I mean, and that's the thing. What I think one of the things that surprised me the most was, where was the rest of the crew, man? Where was the rest of the wrestlers that when Raja hoisted him up that could immediately see, like, bro, this is not going to end well. I have to get down there. Right? Like, that really threw me off. There wasn't an arena show where you're, you know, literally a 20-minute walk away. Yeah. If you know arenas and how they're built, yeah, yeah, no, people could have got there. It's almost some Stanley Milgram shit that you know, the one guy that defies what everyone else is doing steps in and does the quote-unquote right thing. And if you've watched the guy stream since then, I was watching him right before I started, and I think he was in, it sounded like he was in either an 18-wheeler or like a tow truck. So I'm assuming he's, you know, like most of those guys that wrestle, probably has a regular ass job. And he was pretty fucked up by the whole situation all the way around. And somewhat emotional about it all the way around. And it's sad that you can call me a cuck and it's supposed to mean something. This doesn't mean anything to me. Like, there's not many words you're going to say to me. It's going to affect me. You know what I mean?

Does that word even have meaning anymore? When I was back in college a few years ago, it has meaning to Maury. Okay. Well, listen, I remember when I was talking about. Hold on, JJ, just to give you some background, we found out, we found out on one of our after we talk sports, we typically go off the rails a little bit. And Jason did some digging and found out that Connie Chung was getting the business. The business. The business from Warren Beatty while lawfully wedded. And that's a cuck, man. And the thing is, oh, Maury wrote about it in his book and was like, yeah, man. I'll never forget. So a few years ago, when I went back to college, I remember this. So I'm around a bunch of Zoomers when I went back to finish my degree because I took a few years off. It was a hectic time in my life, my 20s. But this girl is like using the word cuck. And I'm like, do you know what a cuck is? And she's like, oh, I thought it meant like it was a combination of cock and fuck or like the C word, you know, the C U word. And I'm like, no, it's, it's, it's a guy who like watches while his wife is doing it with another guy. She's like, oh, I didn't know that. And I'm like, wow, Zoomers don't even know what this word means. It's going to because you can't say kink shame anymore. And there's people that actually dig it. So the whole thing is like, okay, well, if you dig it, then why would I so? Yeah, what you do with another consenting adult or adults behind closed doors, that's your business. I don't care. If you want to fuck while dressed up in a furry anime costume. Knock yourself out. JG looks offended. No, I'm not offended. I wanted to pluck something real quick, though, if I could. I would absolutely go Fleshwood Dan, Daniel Shine. He's here. Yeah, you just brought up his comment. They're doing a wrestling show in California. I know you have listeners there, right? Yeah, where part of California do you know? I actually don't know. Maybe Dan could drop a comment. Dan, last tournament on the left. I live in Mexico, and so I'm close to San Diego, where I'm at. And I'm from the Bay Area. So please let us know where the match is. That would be a fun thing too. It's last tournament on the left. It's a death match. Those things are frightening to me. It dude, yeah. I am every time I like the every time I see one. And JG knows this, like a lot of them in the U.S. like revolve around Matt Cardona. You know, I'm just blown away by the amount that they Connor, don't be mean. Last tournament on the left in Hawaiian Gardens near Long Beach. That's where October 11th. There we go. October 11th. There it is. Now you guys know. Last tournament on the left in Hawaiian Gardens outside of Long Beach. There's going to be a death match. If you don't know what a death match is in wrestling, it is bloody. It is messy. And it's one of those. Oh, my God. Oh my God. Oh, my God. The whole thing is. Oh, my God. Oh my God. Oh, my God. Oh, Drea. That's a champagne room thing. You don't share that. That's what we're going to do, Jason. We'll get some minutes together and we'll just have Drea call in and tell us about her ex's foot thing. Or Drea can show. If Drea shows her feet on a movie night stream, you guys got to become patrons and she'll step on mashed potatoes for uh for an extra to get it a higher tier. She'll step on mashed potatoes. That's right. She'll mashed potatoes like stuffing. Yeah, just stupid shit that people who, if you if you slap ham to that, I'm not going to your house. I'm not, you know, I'm not just not going to your house. I'm not eating anything you put nothing. You are not bringing shit. You having a pot? Look, I'll bring that. No, you won't. No, you're not. No, you won't. You're going to sit outside, as a matter of fact, because we don't trust you. It's like, dude, your wife doesn't wear closed-toed shoes. Okay, so I know what's going on. All right, you weirdo. So I have to apologize. I caught it wrong earlier. Apparently, it's not a deathmatch tournament. It's a horror movie-themed wrestling tournament. Oh, that seems interesting. Which sounds even more awesome. Yeah, interesting. Okay, they're doing some crazy shit. Hey, Carrie just said, Well, it looks like you were all uninvited from the cooker. Can you imagine you're having like a great time? And the one foot guy shows up. He's like, Hey, I, oh, fuck, it's fucking foot guy. God damn it, Phil. Who invited you? I'm a planted foot guy. I brought jello. Of course, you did, you weirdo. Someone hand him the chips. Don't stick your hand in there. Hand him the chips. Put some in a bowl for him. Yeah, fuck that guy. Hey, is hey is Dana here in the corner? Take your jello with you and your bullet chips. Get the fuck out of here. Looks told the biggest dad joke. It sounds like quite a monster match, quite a graveyards match. Well, you know what, Cush, I'm here for it. How did we get on the foot thing? Somebody said you should shame people for having a foot massage. Oh, come on. Haven't we all given a woman a foot massage before? A foot massage and beating your meat to a foot massage are different things. Can we at least agree on that? Or having tomato or having your dick beat off by feet. Okay, like I'm draw the line. I've only dated rough-toed trolls, so that would be jerking off with 30 grits of sandpaper. I've only dated women with hobbit feet, Jason. I have to go. Okay, we all have to go. It's getting late. JG, thank you for joining us, Mac. Of course, JG, it was great meeting you, man. Hey, Jason, maybe we can get Dan on to talk about that last tournament on the left before the 11th. Yeah, we definitely have to. Awesome. Yes, I'm definitely doing. Definitely. Sounds like something hella fun. And we are out. The Subaru a lot to love event going on now through September 2nd at WNL.
