[00:00] There's been a few important AI
[00:01] announcements that we're going to cover
[00:02] here in rapid fire fashion. Number one,
[00:04] remember DeepSeek? They've been kind of
[00:06] quiet, but we're finally hearing what
[00:08] they've been cooking up this whole time.
[00:10] It seems like they're going to be
[00:11] releasing an AI agent this year that's
[00:13] going to compete with Open AI. In other
[00:15] news, News Research releases Husky Holde
[00:19] Bench. It's a benchmark where scripted
[00:21] bots play Texas Holde poker, but here's
[00:23] the twist. Those bots are written by
[00:26] large language models. Kind of a plot
[00:28] twist. I'll show you why in a second.
[00:30] Also, Salesforce CEO Mark Benov saying
[00:33] that there's going to be 4,000 layoffs
[00:35] because he needs less heads with AI.
[00:38] According to the information.com, his
[00:40] words triggered a little bit of an AI
[00:42] crisis narrative. But fear not, OpenAI
[00:45] has a solution. Expanding economic
[00:47] opportunity with AI from OpenAI. Also,
[00:50] there's this. We'll get to that in just
[00:53] a second. So, you might have been
[00:54] hearing a lot of news about DeepSeek.
[00:56] has been laying in wait for a little
[00:58] bit. So, rumors were that Deepseek
[01:01] delayed one of its models because of
[01:03] some difficulty training it on Huawei
[01:06] chips. According to the Financial Times,
[01:08] Deepseek next AI model delayed by
[01:09] attempting to use Chinese chips. This
[01:12] was from August 14th. Seems like they
[01:14] switched over to Nvidia's keeping the
[01:16] Huawei chips in reserve for inference
[01:18] and maybe some future projects, but
[01:21] seems like the Chinese chips aren't
[01:23] quite there yet. not quite competitive
[01:25] with Nvidia and this delayed the
[01:27] project. According to Bloomberg, Deep
[01:30] Seek is building AI model designed to
[01:32] carry out multi-step actions on a
[01:33] person's behalf with minimal direction.
[01:36] The system is also meant to learn and
[01:38] prove based on its prior actions. So,
[01:40] this is a little bit vague. Could
[01:41] learning from past actions mean memory?
[01:44] Maybe this is kind of like the layman's
[01:46] way of referring to reinforcement
[01:47] learning, or is it something much more
[01:49] advanced? We don't yet know. The the
[01:52] first part is pretty clear. There's
[01:53] going to be a new AI model, less like a
[01:55] chatbot and more like an AI agent
[01:57] capable of carrying out multi-step
[01:59] functions, long horizon tasks to be more
[02:01] competitive with open AI and the Western
[02:05] Frontier AI labs. Expect to see that in
[02:07] 2025 this year. Meanwhile, in other
[02:10] news, not that long ago, some of our
[02:12] smartest researchers like Nome Brown,
[02:14] currently at OpenAI, were building AIs
[02:16] that beat humans at poker. Here's
[02:18] Gnome's profile. So he created
[02:21] co-created Pluribus which defeated top
[02:23] human poker professionals in human
[02:24] versus machine competitions. So people
[02:27] would create AI that would beat humans
[02:30] at poker. The article healings is from
[02:33] 2019 just to give you kind of a
[02:35] timeline. And now what five six years
[02:38] later it's kind of flipped on its head.
[02:40] Now we have a benchmark that measures
[02:41] how well AI models large language models
[02:44] can build poker playing bots. It's by
[02:47] Noose Research, who've recently released
[02:49] Hermes 4, and it's called Husky Holde
[02:52] Bench. LMS develop poker bots and
[02:55] compete. It's a benchmark that moves
[02:57] beyond code generation to test strategic
[02:59] thinking and creative problem solving
[03:00] through competitive poker bot
[03:02] development. Bots from each model
[03:04] compete in six-handed tables against all
[03:07] possible opponent combinations, starting
[03:08] with $10,000 per table and playing 1,000
[03:12] hands. Rankings are determined by
[03:14] cumulative winnings. Currently the clads
[03:17] are sitting at the top. Claude sonnet 4
[03:20] is at 3600 delta money. So it made $3672
[03:25] right. So if it started with 10,000 and
[03:27] increased its holdings by 3672 so was at
[03:30] 36%
[03:32] increase on what it started with. Then
[03:33] we have claude opus 4.1 at 3100. Gemini
[03:37] 2.5 pro at just under 3100. Gro 4 at
[03:41] 937. GPT5 high at 396.
[03:46] Gemini 2.5 flash at 111. Hermes 45
[03:51] billion. So that's news researchers
[03:53] that's that's their model, their recent
[03:56] model at -1200. And the rest of the
[03:59] models including some of the famous
[04:02] open- source models are in a negative. I
[04:05] am not surprised to see various cloud
[04:08] models somewhere near the top or at the
[04:10] top. I'm surprised how orly Grock and
[04:13] GPT5 High did here. I think this is
[04:16] going to warrant its very own video
[04:18] because I would love to break down and
[04:21] see why such a such a big difference
[04:23] between those two models and even Grok 4
[04:26] does pretty well on other challenges.
[04:28] Although Grock 4 was never a coding
[04:30] model, but I got to say the benchmarks
[04:33] we're seeing are getting more and more
[04:34] interesting because we're no longer just
[04:36] seeing how well these models answer
[04:37] various test questions. more and more
[04:40] we're forcing them to compete against
[04:42] one another, not just in answering a
[04:45] question, but like long-term tasks that
[04:48] require strategic thinking. This is also
[04:50] involving coding and writing up bots
[04:52] that play poker. This is just a a
[04:54] brilliant benchmark. And once again, yet
[04:57] another phenomenal benchmark to add to
[05:00] the new and exciting novel benchmarks
[05:03] that we can have because these large
[05:04] language models are getting so so good.
[05:07] words escape me. Marco Beanov, the
[05:10] Salesforce CEO, inadvertently stokes AI
[05:13] crisis narrative according to the
[05:14] information now. He's been beating that
[05:17] drum for quite a while. It's important
[05:19] to understand that kind of critics of
[05:21] his stance are saying, well, he's trying
[05:24] to sell everybody on this idea of AI
[05:26] agents. So, he might be kind of talking
[05:28] his own book. So, maybe take it with a
[05:30] grain of salt. But here's yet another
[05:32] person saying that potentially we're
[05:34] going to be seeing less and less jobs as
[05:36] AI takes over. Again, not everyone's
[05:39] seeing eye to eye on it, but OpenAI
[05:42] might have a solution. So, here's their
[05:44] recent blog post, expanding economic
[05:46] opportunity with AI. Fiji Simo, CEO of
[05:48] applications, one of the recent hires.
[05:51] And they start off with one of the first
[05:53] questions they get is, "What's AI going
[05:55] to mean for my job? How it's going to
[05:57] impact my company?" The answer is AI
[05:59] will be disruptive. Jobs will look
[06:02] different. Companies will have to adapt
[06:04] and all of us from shift workers to CEOs
[06:06] will have to learn to work in new ways.
[06:09] So the goal at OpenAI, they're saying we
[06:11] can't eliminate the disruption, but they
[06:13] can help more people be more fluent in
[06:16] AI. So I'll kind of skip to the chase
[06:19] here. They're saying that, you know, if
[06:20] you're a business looking to hire AI
[06:22] savvy people, finding the right person
[06:23] might be hit or miss. The OpenAI jobs
[06:26] platform. So that's one. Number two is
[06:29] OpenAI certification. Basically, as far
[06:32] as I can tell, this is maybe part online
[06:35] certification for AI jobs. Early this
[06:37] year, they launched OpenAI Academy, a
[06:39] free online learning platform. So the
[06:41] idea is to upskill employees and then
[06:45] help employers hire those upskilled
[06:48] employees that are now AI savvy. So
[06:51] obviously a lot of this is really going
[06:53] to be dependent on the execution, how
[06:55] well they execute. this could be a great
[06:57] thing or something that maybe doesn't
[06:59] have much of an impact. But let me know
[07:00] what you think about this. So, OpenAI is
[07:03] providing some of the most used AI
[07:06] models. They're going to be providing it
[07:08] sounds like free certifications for
[07:11] people to upscale and learn AI. So, Open
[07:13] AI Academy, it's a free learning
[07:15] platform to learn AI. Who's teaching you
[07:18] how to use AI? Well, it's AI. So, we
[07:21] obviously use AI to teach AI. anybody
[07:23] will be able to prepare for the
[07:24] certification in Chad GPT's study mode
[07:27] and become certified without leaving the
[07:29] app. So, they're teaching people to use
[07:31] AI. And it sounds like on top of this,
[07:33] there's going to be some sort of an
[07:34] OpenAI jobs platform that's going to
[07:37] help connect businesses that want to
[07:39] hire these certified AI savvy employees.
[07:42] But let me know what you think about
[07:43] this. Do you think OpenAI should be in
[07:45] charge of this? Will anyone do a great
[07:47] job of upskilling people as some of the
[07:50] jobs are replaced so that they're able
[07:52] to find new jobs using AI? Let me know.
[07:55] I'm very curious to know how this is
[07:56] going to work out. Obviously, the the
[07:58] make it or break it is going to be in
[07:59] the execution. I'm I'm curious to know
[08:01] what people think about this thing. In
[08:03] other news, Ilia Sutsk made a tweet. He
[08:06] does not tweet a lot, but when he does,
[08:08] it's about this Ilia merch. And
[08:10] apparently, this is the Ilia merch. You
[08:13] can buy one today. Shipped globally.
[08:15] shipped worldwide. To show your support
[08:17] for Ilia Saskcover, what did I see? He
[08:20] saw this. If you're wondering where you
[08:22] can buy this, I would take a look at the
[08:24] bottom right of the image. That little
[08:26] symbol there means that this was very
[08:28] likely generated by Google's Nano
[08:30] Banana. Somebody took a picture of a
[08:32] hat, a picture of Ilia's head, put it
[08:34] into Nanobanana, and said combined. But
[08:37] Ilia loves it, saying, "A revolutionary
[08:40] breakthrough if I've ever seen one." My
[08:42] question is, can you imagine if he
[08:44] starts tweeting? Can you imagine if he
[08:46] starts trolling people on X? We live in
[08:49] one of the most entertaining timelines
[08:52] possible. At least until one of them
[08:53] builds super intelligence, at which
[08:55] point, well, no one knows. If you made
[08:58] it this far, thank you so much for
[08:59] watching. My name is Wes Roth and I'll
[09:00] see you in the next
