[00:00] Welcome back to the AI daily brief.
[00:02] Today we are talking about the new
[00:04] politics of AI. And I will make note
[00:06] that in general I have found that most
[00:09] of this audience seems to be
[00:11] proportionally more interested to the
[00:13] practical and business aspects of AI
[00:15] than you are to the general macro issues
[00:18] around AI or the politics of AI. And I
[00:20] try to keep that in mind when it comes
[00:22] to designing the content of the show.
[00:24] However, we hit one of those balances of
[00:25] stories where it was enough that it felt
[00:28] relevant and appropriate to do the main
[00:30] this time about this. I promise I will
[00:32] balance it out later this week with some
[00:33] more hyper practical content, including
[00:36] an actual rubric for judging how your
[00:38] company is advancing in AI just to even
[00:40] out the scorecard a little bit. But
[00:42] today, we're going to talk about the new
[00:43] politics of AI and specifically it
[00:45] coming into its place as just a major
[00:48] salient national and international
[00:50] geopolitical issue. As you might not be
[00:52] surprised to learn, part of the context
[00:54] for this is the completion of this deal
[00:56] for the US to take a 10% stake in Intel.
[01:00] This is something that had been possible
[01:01] in the headlines for a little while now
[01:03] and is the latest in the very frankly
[01:06] belleaguered story of Intel. On Friday,
[01:09] Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik
[01:10] announced, "The United States of America
[01:12] now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great
[01:15] American technology companies. The
[01:17] historic agreement strengthens US
[01:18] leadership in semiconductors, which will
[01:20] both grow our economy and help secure
[01:22] America's technological edge. Thanks to
[01:24] Intel CEO Le Bhutan for striking a deal
[01:26] that's fair to Intel and fair to the
[01:28] American people. As Bloomberg writes,
[01:30] the deal represents a dramatic reversal
[01:32] from earlier this month when Trump
[01:34] called for Tan's ouster and accused him
[01:36] of being highly conflicted because of
[01:37] concerns over his earlier ties to China.
[01:40] It was those remarks that led to an
[01:42] ultimate sitdown between President Trump
[01:44] and the Intel CEO, which ultimately led
[01:46] to this deal. Trump told reporters at
[01:48] the White House, "They've agreed to do
[01:49] it, and I think it's a great deal for
[01:50] them." Now, under the terms of the deal,
[01:52] the government will receive a 9.9% stake
[01:55] made up of newly issued non- voting
[01:56] shares. The government won't be taking a
[01:58] board seat and will have no formal say
[02:00] in any governance of the company. Still,
[02:02] this means that the US government will
[02:04] be Intel's single largest shareholder
[02:05] and will have, of course, significant
[02:07] soft power to align the company with the
[02:09] government's priorities. In exchange,
[02:11] the government has agreed to release the
[02:12] remaining 8.9 billion in chips act
[02:14] funding, combined with the 2.2 billion
[02:17] already distributed, the
[02:18] administration's logic is that the deal
[02:19] is paid in full using the previously
[02:21] committed funding. Most people involved
[02:23] in financial markets didn't see it that
[02:25] way, writes Bloomberg. By the way, not
[02:27] in their opinion piece, but just in
[02:28] their general story. The US taking
[02:30] partial ownership marks a stunning level
[02:32] of intervention in an American company,
[02:34] cutting against the principles of free
[02:36] market capitalism that investors and
[02:37] policymakers have long considered
[02:39] sacrosanked, except in the most
[02:41] extraordinary situations such as war or
[02:43] a systemic economic crisis. Commentators
[02:45] on X variously referred to the deal as
[02:47] fascism, communism, or just straight up
[02:49] extortion. California Governor Gavin
[02:51] Newsome shared a meme of Chinese
[02:53] chairman Trump and noted, "The Socialist
[02:55] Republic of America enters a bold new
[02:57] era of governmentrun businesses."
[02:59] Meanwhile, Democratic Socialist Senator
[03:01] Bernie Sanders saw no problem with the
[03:02] deal, stating, "If microchip companies
[03:04] make a profit from the generous grants
[03:05] they receive from the federal
[03:06] government, the taxpayers of America
[03:08] have a right to a reasonable return on
[03:10] that investment." Squigger from the
[03:11] Young Turk says, "Old school
[03:13] conservatives are saying Trump's plan to
[03:14] take a 10% stake in intel for American
[03:16] taxpayers in exchange for our financial
[03:18] help is socialism. Truth is exactly the
[03:20] opposite. In capitalism, if you invest
[03:21] in a company, you get equity." This is
[03:23] one of the best things Trump is doing.
[03:25] Both parties have given endless
[03:26] subsidies to their corporate buddies out
[03:27] of our pockets and only gotten campaign
[03:29] contributions back. That's why sellouts
[03:31] in DC are panicking about their beloved
[03:33] donors. They expect our money for
[03:34] nothing. No, we want shares like any
[03:36] investor. Now, this was a little
[03:38] tongue-in-cheek, but not totally. To
[03:40] refine the argument a little bit from
[03:42] picking your favorite ism and labeling
[03:44] this that, the deal was explicitly done
[03:47] to accelerate the grant timelines in
[03:48] hopes of Intel completing their new fab
[03:50] in Ohio. The company has struggled to
[03:52] get private funding off the ground in
[03:54] part due to leadership squables around
[03:56] fundraising at the board level. Chips
[03:57] Act funds were previously tied to
[03:59] progress milestones, so pulling it all
[04:01] forward is a significant gratuitity.
[04:04] Still, it's of course understandable why
[04:05] there's so much unease around requiring
[04:07] an equity stake in exchange for
[04:08] government funding. There's been a bit
[04:10] of variable discussion around whether
[04:12] the administration would seek a similar
[04:13] deal with other CHIPS beneficiaries like
[04:15] TSMC or Micron. Compounding these
[04:18] concerns, earlier in the year, Commerce
[04:19] Secretary Lutnik pushed to establish a
[04:21] sovereign wealth fund by taking equity
[04:22] stakes in exchange for government
[04:24] contracts. While this deal is a pretty
[04:26] mild version of that concept, it
[04:27] suggests that this is a broader
[04:29] government strategy rather than a
[04:30] one-off emergency measure. Stepping back
[04:32] from the ideological argument, analysts
[04:34] also noted that Intel doesn't just need
[04:36] capital, they need customers. Dan
[04:38] Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at
[04:39] Cynis Trust, said, "Trump kind of
[04:41] becomes your salesperson." Bernstein
[04:43] analyst Stacy Ragson wrote in a note,
[04:45] "Funding a buildout with no customers
[04:47] probably won't end well for
[04:48] shareholders, of whom the US government
[04:49] would be the largest under the
[04:50] situation." Now, at the end of the day,
[04:52] this is of course not just the US
[04:54] government taking a stake in some random
[04:56] tech company. The big question here is
[04:58] whether the US needs domestic chipmaking
[05:00] as a national security imperative or
[05:02] not. Political reporter Cigar and Jetty
[05:04] wrote, "Taking a stake in Intel is much
[05:06] better than the pay-forplay structure
[05:08] for Nvidia and AMD. Intel's managerial
[05:10] decline is a major reason we're so
[05:12] vulnerable on chip manufacturing. If
[05:14] left to the fake free market, we will
[05:16] continue to get beaten by subsidized
[05:17] TSMC, Samsung, and SIMC. The point is
[05:21] that for some observers, where this gets
[05:22] blurry is the national security
[05:24] consideration of domestic chip
[05:25] manufacturing capacity, which takes this
[05:27] out of the realm of just generic debate
[05:29] and into its own very specific
[05:30] situation. Now, it's obviously way
[05:32] outside the scope of this show to get
[05:34] into those debates in general. For our
[05:36] purposes, what's important to note is
[05:38] that AI finds itself once again at the
[05:40] epicenter of an important shift in the
[05:41] political tides that could have big
[05:43] ramifications in the years to come. Now,
[05:46] speaking of that Nvidia deal, their
[05:48] roller coaster ride in the Chinese
[05:49] market continues as they halt production
[05:52] of H20 chips. The information reports
[05:54] that Nvidia has instructed suppliers to
[05:56] stop production related to their China
[05:58] specific chips. The chips have been, to
[06:00] put it mildly, a political football in
[06:02] both Washington and Beijing all year.
[06:04] The US government had banned H20 exports
[06:06] until this month when the president
[06:08] struck a deal with Nvidia and AMD. The
[06:10] arrangement was that export licenses
[06:12] would be granted in exchange for a 15%
[06:14] cut of sales. Shortly after that,
[06:16] however, China opened an investigation
[06:18] into Nvidia, accusing them of including
[06:20] back doors in the chips. Beijing later
[06:22] went farther, warning local firms not to
[06:24] use Nvidia chips and to reconsider their
[06:26] orders. That seems to have had an effect
[06:28] with sources saying that the entire H20
[06:30] supply chain has been shut down as a
[06:32] result. Those sources added that Nvidia
[06:34] and their Chinese customers are hoping
[06:35] to get approval to sell an updated chip
[06:37] based on the new Blackwell architecture.
[06:40] The Trump administration has flagged
[06:41] that they would be open to a deal
[06:42] provided the new chips have 30 to 50%
[06:44] less performance than US market chips.
[06:47] Trump himself set those parameters after
[06:48] calling the Blackwell chips quote super
[06:50] duper advanced. Now, we don't have a
[06:53] good sense of how Nvidia could possibly
[06:54] assure Beijing about the safety of the
[06:56] chips or whether the prohibition is
[06:58] actually about protecting Huawei from
[07:00] competition. Some outlets are even
[07:02] suggesting that the ban was pure
[07:03] politics with Chinese officials calling
[07:05] US commerce secretary Howard Lutnik's
[07:07] comments that Chinese developers were
[07:08] addicted to Nvidia chips insulting.
[07:11] Jimmy Goodrich's senior adviser to think
[07:13] tank ran said China wants to have the
[07:14] best chips but also wants to have
[07:16] domestic chips at the same time. Those
[07:18] two goals are in conflict with one
[07:19] another. If the US government were to
[07:21] approve a powerful Blackwell chip for
[07:23] China, even at 30 to 50% performance
[07:25] reduction, my guess is we'd miraculously
[07:27] see China forget about security
[07:29] concerns. In an official statement,
[07:31] Nvidia appeared sympathetic to concerns
[07:33] from Beijing. They said, "China won't
[07:35] rely on American chips for government
[07:37] operations, just like the US government
[07:38] would not rely on chips from China.
[07:40] However, allowing US chips for
[07:42] beneficial commercial business use is
[07:43] good for everyone." A spokesperson noted
[07:46] that Nvidia has several hundred,000
[07:47] units in a stockpile ready to be shipped
[07:49] and that they quote constantly manage
[07:51] our supply chain to address market
[07:52] conditions. That's still a notable
[07:54] turnaround from earlier this month when
[07:55] Nvidia seemed to be gearing up to
[07:57] produce H20s as fast as possible. During
[07:59] a visit to Taiwan on Friday, CEO Jensen
[08:02] Hong gave a status update, commenting,
[08:03] "It's up to, of course, the United
[08:05] States government. We're in dialogue
[08:06] with them, but it's still too soon to
[08:08] know." Speaking to Beijing's concerns,
[08:10] he added, "We're surprised by that. They
[08:12] requested and urged us to secure
[08:14] licenses for the H20s for some time. And
[08:17] this is really the other dimension of
[08:18] the political story when it comes to
[08:20] chips. The US is thinking not only about
[08:22] its domestic production capabilities,
[08:24] but also export controls, which in and
[08:26] of itself is a complex set of
[08:27] considerations. Do you focus on denying
[08:29] China access to the most advanced chips?
[08:31] Or do you try to expand access and think
[08:34] about model access and chip access as a
[08:35] form of soft power? A recent Reddit post
[08:38] quoted A16Z partner Martin Casado who
[08:40] said that when startups apply to A16Z
[08:42] for funding, there's a quote 80% chance
[08:45] they're using a Chinese open- source
[08:46] model. Lastly, bringing the political
[08:49] consideration back home. Earlier this
[08:50] week, a group of Silicon Valley
[08:52] investors and builders announced a new
[08:53] AI pack in advance of next year's
[08:55] midterm elections. The Wall Street
[08:57] Journal writes, "Silicon Valley is
[08:59] putting more than $100 million into a
[09:01] network of political action committees
[09:02] and organizations to advocate against
[09:04] strict AI regulations. a signal that
[09:06] tech executives will be active in next
[09:08] year's midterm elections. The big new
[09:10] pack being announced is called Leading
[09:11] the Future. They wrote on Twitter, "AI
[09:14] is already transforming the global
[09:15] economy and America should lead in
[09:17] advancing a policy governing AI
[09:18] expansion that drives innovation and
[09:20] broad economic growth for working people
[09:22] across the country. Leading the future
[09:24] and its affiliated organizations will
[09:25] promote policies that unlock the
[09:27] transformative and economic benefits of
[09:28] AI. LTF and its affiliated organizations
[09:31] will oppose policies that stifle
[09:32] innovation, enable China to gain global
[09:34] AI superiority or make it harder to
[09:36] bring AI's benefits into the world and
[09:38] those who support that agenda. In their
[09:41] announcement press release, LTF got a
[09:42] little bit more detailed about how they
[09:44] plan to operate. They write, "LTF will
[09:46] operate through a structured ecosystem
[09:48] of federal and state super PACs and
[09:49] 501c4 issue advocacy organizations,
[09:52] giving it maximum flexibility to engage
[09:54] in the 2026 election cycle and beyond.
[09:56] The federal and state super PACs will
[09:58] focus on independent expenditures to
[09:59] support candidates aligned with the
[10:01] pro-AI agenda and ensure America leads
[10:03] the world in AI innovation and oppose
[10:04] those that do not. These efforts will
[10:06] span both primary and general elections
[10:08] aiming to reshape the political
[10:09] environment around innovation policy.
[10:11] The C4 organizations will lead proactive
[10:13] policy development, legislative
[10:15] scorecard production, grassroots
[10:16] engagement, and rapid response campaigns
[10:18] to counter misinformation and
[10:20] anti-inovation narratives. They plan to
[10:22] begin their operations in New York,
[10:23] California, Illinois, and Ohio, and will
[10:25] expand into a national footprint
[10:27] throughout next year. Leading the future
[10:29] is led by Zack Moffat, previously
[10:30] founder and CEO of Targeted Victory,
[10:32] which has raised over $2 billion and
[10:34] served over a thousand campaigns since
[10:35] 2009, as well as Josh Blasto, who was
[10:38] previously press secretary to US Senator
[10:40] Chuck Schumer and chief of staff to New
[10:41] York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Some of the
[10:43] backers are common names at the
[10:44] intersection of Silicon Valley in
[10:46] Washington. Ron Conway wrote, "I'm
[10:48] excited to be part of leading the
[10:49] future. AI is so important. It
[10:51] transcends Democrats and Republicans. It
[10:53] is in America's interest to lead. The
[10:55] only thing that stands in America's way
[10:56] are bad policies that will cause America
[10:58] to lose its lead to China. We have to
[11:00] play to win. Imagine if we're not all on
[11:01] the page when it came to the race to the
[11:03] moon. We would have never even made it
[11:04] to the launch pad. A newer participant
[11:07] in this political game is OpenAI
[11:09] president and co-founder Greg Brockman.
[11:11] He writes, "My wife Anna and I are
[11:13] supporting Leading the Future because we
[11:14] believe that AI can massively improve
[11:16] quality of life for every person and
[11:17] every animal. We believe the goal of AI
[11:19] policy should be to unlock this outcome.
[11:21] That means taking a balanced view, which
[11:23] we think of as optimistic realism
[11:25] towards achieving AI's benefits. We're
[11:27] excited about the future. Now, so far,
[11:29] Leading the Future hasn't gotten
[11:30] specific around any particular issues or
[11:32] positions that it's going to be focused
[11:33] on, but I would expect this to be the
[11:35] very first of a lot of AI related
[11:38] political activity heading into next
[11:40] year's midterms. One of the things that
[11:42] was really interesting about the
[11:43] presidential election last year was how
[11:45] little ultimately AI factored in. There
[11:48] were grand concerns around
[11:49] disinformation and deep fakes, none of
[11:51] which really came to bear. Also, as much
[11:54] as people were theoretically interested
[11:56] in the issues of AI, they were still
[11:58] pretty firmly in the realm of the future
[11:59] last time. What'll be interesting to see
[12:02] this time around during these midterms
[12:03] is how much those issues actually come
[12:05] home to roost in the here and now. Will
[12:08] AI related job loss be something that
[12:10] people actually care about in Congress
[12:12] and Senate races in the heartland of
[12:13] America? Will competition with China be
[12:16] something that politicians actually talk
[12:17] about? Too early to know, but it's very
[12:19] clear that the AI industry is going to
[12:21] have a seat at that table. For now
[12:23] though, that is going to do it for
[12:24] today's AI daily brief. Appreciate you
[12:26] listening or watching as always and
[12:27] until next time, peace.
