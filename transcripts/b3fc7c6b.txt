[00:00] Welcome back to the AI Daily Brief
[00:01] headlines edition. All the daily AI news
[00:03] you need in around 5 minutes. Could it
[00:06] actually be happening? Are we actually
[00:09] going to get a play from Apple on AI?
[00:12] The Certino giant appears to have made a
[00:15] call and will partner with Google on
[00:17] their next AI offering. Bloomberg's
[00:19] Apple insider Mark German reports that
[00:21] the project will be an AI powered search
[00:23] engine known internally as World
[00:25] Knowledge Answers. Sources said that the
[00:27] feature will be integrated into Siri and
[00:29] that Apple are also considering building
[00:30] it into Safari and their home screen
[00:32] search widget spotlight. The feature is
[00:34] expected to be ready by the spring as
[00:36] part of a long overdue Siri overhaul.
[00:39] Sources said that the idea is to
[00:40] replicate the performance of Google's AI
[00:42] overviews or Perplexity. The underlying
[00:45] technology enabling the new Siri could
[00:46] come in part from Google, Apple's
[00:48] longtime partner in internet search. The
[00:50] companies reached a formal agreement
[00:52] this week for Apple to evaluate and test
[00:54] a Google developed AI model to help
[00:56] power the voice assistant. The reporting
[00:58] also spoke to a much broader Siri
[01:00] revision that's in the works. The new
[01:01] Siri is intended to be able to tap into
[01:03] personal data and on-screen content to
[01:05] better fulfill queries. This was, of
[01:07] course, the original idea of so-called
[01:09] Apple intelligence to have the context
[01:12] of your personal experience expressed
[01:14] through mobile that would make AI better
[01:16] for you. Now, of course, none of that
[01:18] vision has come to fruition, but the
[01:20] vision was something that many people
[01:21] were interested in theoretically at
[01:23] least. The reporting also suggests that
[01:25] Siri will become a computer use agent
[01:27] able to navigate an Apple device
[01:28] according to voice instructions. Craig
[01:30] Federigi, Apple's head of software
[01:32] engineering and the executive in charge
[01:33] of the Siri project said at a race in
[01:35] all hands, "The work we've done on this
[01:37] endto-end revamp of Siri has given us
[01:39] the results we've needed. This has put
[01:41] us in a position to not just deliver
[01:42] what we announced, but to deliver a much
[01:44] bigger upgrade than we envisioned. The
[01:46] project has drawn in talent from
[01:47] multiple teams including the AI division
[01:49] and the Apple services unit helmed by
[01:51] executive Eddie Q. You might recognize
[01:53] that name as the person who has
[01:54] reportedly been pushing for acquisitions
[01:56] as a path for Apple to get back in the
[01:58] AI competition. Although he has not been
[02:00] successful in convincing his colleagues
[02:02] around that series new architecture is
[02:04] reportedly split into three components.
[02:06] A planner, a search system, and a
[02:08] summarizer to put it all together into
[02:10] an output. Sources said that Apple is
[02:12] leaning towards using a customuilt
[02:13] version of Google's Gemini model as the
[02:15] summarizer. It would need to be modified
[02:17] to run on Apple's proprietary hardware
[02:18] and the two companies are now
[02:19] collaborating on fine-tuning and
[02:21] testing. Apple is also considering using
[02:23] Gemini for the planner, although
[02:24] Anthropics Claude and Apple's own
[02:26] in-house models are still being
[02:27] considered as well. The reporting also
[02:29] said that Gemini hasn't been ruled out
[02:31] to drive the search system. In other
[02:33] words, in 6 months time, we could have a
[02:34] version of Siri built entirely on
[02:36] Google's tech. Reportedly, Anthropic's
[02:38] Claude actually outperformed Google in
[02:40] the Siri bakeoff, but Anthropic demanded
[02:42] too much money for the use of their
[02:43] model. Sources said that they asked for
[02:45] more than 1.5 billion a year while
[02:47] Google was up to much more favorable
[02:48] terms. Now, one unspoken part of the
[02:51] reporting that I think is pretty
[02:52] interesting is the fact that OpenAI is
[02:53] nowhere in these conversations despite
[02:55] the fact that Chat GPT was the first
[02:57] third party AI app that Apple started
[02:59] pushing on the iPhone in that
[03:00] presentation about a year ago. I don't
[03:02] know what happened with that
[03:03] relationship, whether the fallout is
[03:05] from a business or a technological
[03:06] perspective, but it is notable that
[03:08] OpenAI is nowhere to be seen here.
[03:11] Still, I think at this point for most
[03:12] people, just having Siri that actually
[03:14] works, like anything even close to how
[03:16] you would expect in 2025, will be a big
[03:18] win. Speaking of OpenAI, there has
[03:21] continued to be incredible demand for
[03:23] shares in that company. They have
[03:25] boosted their secondary share sale up to
[03:27] 10 billion, an increase from the 6
[03:29] billion reported last month. Current and
[03:31] former employees who have held shares
[03:32] for more than 2 years will have until
[03:34] the end of the month to decide whether
[03:35] they'll access that liquidity. The round
[03:37] is expected to close in October. Now,
[03:39] the round is noteworthy because it's the
[03:41] first to test OpenAI at a 500 billion
[03:43] valuation. Their last fundraising was,
[03:46] of course, conducted at the start of the
[03:47] year at 300 billion. Since then, the
[03:49] company has doubled its revenue and
[03:50] basically everything else, including
[03:52] users. So, some big markup sort of makes
[03:54] sense, although the numbers are eye
[03:56] popping to some. Still, when push comes
[03:58] to shove, we continue to see the trend
[04:00] of demand for AI startup investments
[04:02] vastly outstripping supply as the number
[04:04] of shares that the market wants to
[04:05] consume just seems to keep going up.
[04:08] Another update on the AI fundraising
[04:09] front. Mistral is set to finalize aâ‚¬2
[04:12] billion euro investment that would value
[04:14] the company at roughly 14 billion. The
[04:16] rumor from last month was that they were
[04:18] seeking a billion in fundraising at a
[04:20] $10 billion valuation. So quite a lot of
[04:22] additional funding and a meaningful bump
[04:23] in the valuation seems to have come
[04:25] through. This will be the first round of
[04:27] Mistral fundraising since June of last
[04:28] year when they were valued at 5.8
[04:30] billion. Now, not only does this mean
[04:32] their valuation has doubled, but more
[04:34] notably, it'll be the first time that
[04:36] they've had access to such a significant
[04:37] war chest. They've raised around a
[04:39] billion in total in the 2 and 1/2 years
[04:41] since they were founded. So, this would
[04:43] be double that all in one fell swoop.
[04:45] It's still not super clear to me exactly
[04:47] where Mistl is going to fit in this
[04:49] ecosystem, but it's clear that there's a
[04:51] lot of folks who think that they have a
[04:52] place somewhere. Quick update on talent
[04:55] drama. XAI's CFO has left after just
[04:58] three months on the job. The Wall Street
[04:59] Journal reports that CFO Mike Liberator
[05:01] left the company around the end of July
[05:03] after commencing in April. Liberator
[05:05] oversaw XAI's debt and equity raise in
[05:07] June, which brought in 10 billion in
[05:09] fresh capital for the company. SpaceX
[05:11] contributed almost half of the equity
[05:12] raised, which suggested to some that
[05:14] demand from outside investors was
[05:16] comparatively sparse, at least relative
[05:18] to all these other rounds that we're
[05:19] seeing. Now, while it's dangerous to
[05:20] draw too many conclusions from a single
[05:22] departure, this is the latest in a
[05:24] recent trend. At the beginning of
[05:25] August, XAI's general counsel, Robert
[05:27] Keel, announced he was leaving after a
[05:29] little more than a year on the job. In
[05:30] his farewell post, he claimed he was
[05:32] leaving to spend more time with his two
[05:33] toddlers, something that any toddler
[05:34] parent will understand, but also noted
[05:36] that when it came to Elon Musk, quote,
[05:38] "There's daylight between our
[05:39] worldviews." Rahu Rao, a senior lawyer
[05:41] who dealt with commercial affairs at the
[05:43] company, left around the same time. And
[05:45] then on August 13th, co-founder Igor
[05:46] Pabushkin announced that he was leaving
[05:48] to start his own venture firm. There was
[05:50] of course also ex CEO Linda Yakarino
[05:52] announcing her departure in July, a few
[05:54] months after the social media platforms
[05:55] merger with XAI. AAM's razor continues
[05:58] to be that people in high impact jobs
[06:00] move around a lot more than people where
[06:01] the stakes are lower. But there's enough
[06:03] happening there that for anyone who's
[06:05] really interested in how much the
[06:06] competition between all these labs is
[06:08] going to increase the availability of
[06:09] cool products for all of us, let's just
[06:11] say it's worth paying at least a little
[06:12] bit of attention to. Lastly, a sort of
[06:15] messy one. Scale has sued rival data
[06:18] labeling startup Merkor accusing the
[06:19] firm of corporate espionage. In a
[06:21] lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Scale
[06:23] claimed that their former head of
[06:24] engagement management Eugene Ling
[06:26] downloaded more than 100 customer
[06:27] strategy documents while in
[06:28] communication with Merkor. He's accused
[06:30] of meeting with Merkor CEO Brendan Foody
[06:32] to discuss business strategy and product
[06:34] while still in his role at scale. The
[06:36] lawsuit claims that Ling was later hired
[06:38] in order to build a relationship with
[06:39] one of Scale's largest customers and
[06:41] that the bulk of the documents relate to
[06:42] that customer. Ling is allegedly still
[06:44] assigned to this customer's account
[06:46] while working at Merkore. Surya Midha, a
[06:48] Murkor co-founder, responded to the
[06:50] lawsuit stating, "While Merkor has hired
[06:52] many people who departed Scale, we have
[06:53] no interest in any of Scale's trade
[06:55] secrets and in fact are intentionally
[06:57] running our business in a different
[06:58] way." Eugene informed us that he had old
[07:00] documents in a personal Google Drive,
[07:01] which we have never accessed and are now
[07:03] investigating. We reached out to Scale 6
[07:05] days ago, offering to have Eugene
[07:06] destroy the files or reach a different
[07:08] resolution, and we are now awaiting
[07:09] their response. Now, of course, the
[07:11] situation is made even messier due to
[07:12] Meta's Aqua Hire deal with Scale. It has
[07:15] been well reported that Scale lost
[07:16] multiple major clients in the wake of
[07:17] that deal, as rival AI Labs didn't
[07:20] necessarily want to continue doing
[07:21] business with them after Meta became a
[07:22] major owner. Then of course there's the
[07:24] fact that earlier this week it was
[07:25] reported that Meta themselves had also
[07:27] moved away from using scales data
[07:29] labeling services adding rival providers
[07:31] including Merkor. So I guess maybe the
[07:33] takeaway that is if you are looking for
[07:34] signs that AI is slowing down when it
[07:36] comes to things like big company
[07:38] competition, talent wars, fundraising or
[07:42] basically any other vector. The answer
[07:43] is most distinctly no. However, that's
[07:46] going to do it for today's AI daily
[07:47] brief headlines edition. Next up, the
[07:48] main
