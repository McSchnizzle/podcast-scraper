[00:00] Imagine typing in one sentence and
[00:01] getting a full clean slide deck. Images,
[00:05] charts, icons, layouts ready to present.
[00:07] Today, I'll show you something that does
[00:09] exactly that. Genpark AI slides uses a
[00:12] powerful super agent to turn your ideas
[00:15] and even your files if you want into
[00:17] polished, sharable presentations. It can
[00:19] do deep research for references, analyze
[00:21] content, and assemble slides with smart
[00:24] icons, stylish visuals, and clean
[00:26] layouts, and even charts, audio, and
[00:28] video. It's a design team inside your
[00:31] browser. This video is sponsored by Gen
[00:33] Sparks. As always, you'll see a real
[00:36] unedited demo so you can see if this
[00:38] fits your workflow. So, step one, let's
[00:40] build a tech explainer deck. We're going
[00:43] to start with the AI slides. As you can
[00:45] see here, there are hundreds of free
[00:48] templates available. You can use any of
[00:50] these or later once you create your own,
[00:52] you can save them as my templates. We're
[00:54] going to start with this. Create a 10
[00:56] slide deck that explains what are AI
[00:58] agents. For a non-technical audience,
[01:01] include a simple diagram, a timeline of
[01:03] milestones and one slide of pros and
[01:06] cons. Keep the tone friendly and visuals
[01:08] minimal. And let's hit go. All right.
[01:11] So, as you can see here, it's going to
[01:13] work using various tools to read the
[01:15] internet such as Amazon, IBM, Google,
[01:18] etc. The slides will appear here on the
[01:20] right side once they're generated. All
[01:23] right. So after we hit generate and it
[01:25] goes through the deep research phase
[01:28] getting all the materials together now
[01:31] it starts jaring the slides. Genspark
[01:34] researches drafts titles and bullets and
[01:36] lays out all the slides with the icons
[01:38] and supporting visuals. The clean grid
[01:41] keeps everything aligned. We've got
[01:43] structure. We've got the title slide.
[01:45] What is an AI agents? How do they work?
[01:47] Overviews, diagrams, timelines, and the
[01:52] pros and cons. Just like we asked. All
[01:54] the edits are made with natural
[01:56] language. We prompted here. I'm going to
[01:58] add design a structural page layout with
[02:01] clean grid but playful symmetry. Bold
[02:03] title zones, wide text on one side,
[02:06] large visuals or charts on the other.
[02:08] Use subtle accent color blocks behind
[02:10] key sections for energy without clutter.
[02:13] We're going to make this look good. I
[02:15] like how it is now. Very clean. But
[02:17] let's see if we can spice it up a little
[02:19] bit. So, it's slowly beginning to redo
[02:21] each and every single slide. So, it's
[02:23] still working on six, etc. Six, seven,
[02:27] eight, and looks like it's actually just
[02:29] got finished with all of them. So, let's
[02:30] take a look. The structural page layout
[02:33] is exactly what we were looking for.
[02:36] That's exactly what I asked for.
[02:38] Definitely makes it pop a little bit.
[02:39] Makes it a little bit asymmetrical with
[02:42] little visuals that are popping out from
[02:43] the sides. So, definitely has got a
[02:45] little zing to it. But let's change the
[02:48] color scheme a little bit. Right, we're
[02:49] going to say make the theme more tech
[02:51] oriented. Use green, black, and white as
[02:53] the primary colors. And here are our
[02:56] results. It's looking great. That's
[02:58] exactly what I was looking for. It's got
[03:00] the greens, black, white background.
[03:03] Perfect. I love it. Definitely seems a
[03:06] little bit more techoriented, I would
[03:08] say. I'm liking the look of this. Now,
[03:10] Genparks allows you to save your
[03:13] templates. So, you can keep reusing this
[03:14] in the future. If you like a certain
[03:16] layout or look, just save it as save it
[03:19] into my templates and then reuse it
[03:21] whenever you want to. One thing to keep
[03:23] in mind is that if something is not to
[03:25] your liking, you can always hit advanced
[03:27] edit. This is actually going to allow
[03:29] you to do those minor tweaks and manual
[03:32] edits. You don't like this green
[03:34] floating thing here, it's gone. You want
[03:36] to change some text, you can do that as
[03:38] well. Pretty cool. Cool. I just noticed
[03:40] they used the robboto theme to make it a
[03:43] little bit more tech oriented, which is
[03:45] pretty cool. Now, really fast, let's say
[03:46] we wanted to add an image to one of the
[03:49] pages. We're going to say add an AI or
[03:51] agent image the first page. Now, we
[03:54] could have prompted it in the beginning
[03:55] to add more images by saying something
[03:57] like use a more of a like a infographic
[04:00] thing or a magazine layout, which would
[04:03] naturally contain more images. We
[04:05] specified that we wanted to be a little
[04:06] bit more simple, less visuals. So now
[04:09] let's just add one image to the
[04:11] beginning to see how that works. As you
[04:14] can see here, it's generating a GPT
[04:16] image. All right, it generated that
[04:18] image for us. And now it's going to add
[04:20] it to the first slide. And boom, there
[04:24] it is. Looking pretty good. If we wanted
[04:27] to change it to a custom image, that's
[04:28] super simple. Let's click the advanced
[04:30] edit and click the image. You have a
[04:33] number of options here, including, you
[04:35] know, dragging it to make it bigger or
[04:37] replacing it. replace it by uploading or
[04:40] image URL. I have this image from
[04:42] MidJourney. Let's try it out. And I
[04:44] click to replace the image. And there it
[04:46] is. Let's just make sure it's
[04:48] positioned. And maybe make it a little
[04:50] bit larger like that. The whole thing
[04:53] gets automatically saved. And just like
[04:55] that, we have a cool looking AI agent
[04:58] image on the first page. Easy. Next,
[05:01] we're going to do a file to deck flow.
[05:03] I'm going to upload a PDF document and
[05:06] an Excel spreadsheet. These contain
[05:08] quarterly numbers for a fictional
[05:10] business. And for the prompt, we'll say,
[05:12] "Build a 12 slide client proposal
[05:15] summarizing the PDF. Use the Excel for a
[05:17] trend chart. Keep it boardroom ready.
[05:20] Showcase important insights about the
[05:21] business and easy to understand
[05:23] visuals." So, Jen Sparks went deep into
[05:26] the documents, went through the two
[05:28] documents that we uploaded that that had
[05:29] quite a bit of information in there
[05:31] about a fictional business called Moss
[05:35] Eley Cantina. If that doesn't ring a
[05:37] bell, it's a bar on the planet of
[05:40] Tatooine containing some of the most
[05:42] villainous scum in the galaxy. So, I
[05:44] created a fictional quarterly sales,
[05:47] etc. So, as you can see here, Gen Sparks
[05:49] managed to put it together into a very
[05:51] nice looking presentation. It pulls
[05:53] headlines, the key points from
[05:56] everything that I've uploaded. It
[05:57] creates images and autogenerates a very
[06:00] clean agenda. Executive summary, revenue
[06:03] trends, experience optimizations, risk
[06:06] and compliance. You get it. Notice
[06:09] everything is looking very, very good.
[06:11] The charts are very nice. Everything is
[06:14] very clean. Notice it doesn't screw up
[06:16] the currency. Keeps everything in
[06:18] credits. It shows yearover-year growth
[06:21] and trends. They notice a 30% reduction
[06:24] incidence rates. So decrease in
[06:26] incidents per thousand patrons through
[06:28] standardized security staffing. Smart.
[06:31] All right, but let's make some changes
[06:33] to it. So we're going to say shorten all
[06:34] slide titles to under four words.
[06:37] Replace any filler text with action
[06:39] verbs. So I type my edits in here and
[06:42] click go. And notice we can save it to
[06:44] notion. All of this can be exported in
[06:46] whatever format we want. We are also
[06:48] able to see the code. So this is the
[06:51] HTML behind it. So that you're able to
[06:53] just use the code if you want. just
[06:54] export that. You're also able to share
[06:56] this entire project with whomever you
[06:58] want through email. Notice that most of
[07:00] the edits will have its own save points.
[07:03] As you can see here, almost every minute
[07:05] it seems like it's saving and has a
[07:07] separate save point. So, if you want to
[07:09] go back if something screwed up, you can
[07:11] go back with a lot of precision. So,
[07:13] trimmed the fluff. It reduced the
[07:15] headlines to under four words. which
[07:17] looks like most of them are now too you
[07:18] know performance over you revenue growth
[07:20] and it replaced any filler text with
[07:23] action verb like achieved consistent
[07:25] growth and projecting this delivered
[07:28] that. So perfect looking very corporate
[07:31] friendly now. Now it's still finishing
[07:32] up the last few slides but the next edit
[07:34] we're going to make is this. We're going
[07:35] to say add a case study slide with a
[07:38] three item stat strip. So it creates a
[07:41] brand new slide. It shows it's thinking
[07:43] for a while about what needs to be get
[07:45] done. Everything seems very smart, very
[07:48] reasonable, and then starts cranking out
[07:50] the code to create the slide. Here's the
[07:52] preview. If you're wondering what a
[07:54] three item stat strip is. Here's what
[07:57] that's looking like. So, this is a
[07:59] success case study. Bif band night
[08:01] initiative. And basically, as you can
[08:04] see here, everything worked out. Great
[08:06] ROI. The three stats statistics are
[08:09] highlighted here across the top. This is
[08:12] perfect. Theme changes are super simple.
[08:15] We're going to say let's switch to dark
[08:16] theme. So if you don't recall the
[08:18] cantina from the movie, it was a dark
[08:20] place, but it had these earthy sandy
[08:23] colors. So we're going to try to kind of
[08:25] capture that within our presentation.
[08:28] We're going to say switch to dark theme
[08:29] with some earthy sandy colors. And we're
[08:32] going to say use sentence case for
[08:34] titles. Right? So usually titles uh are
[08:36] capitalized, all letters are
[08:38] capitalized. Sentence case is the
[08:40] regular sort of, you know, first letter
[08:42] capitalized, the rest non-c capitalized.
[08:44] So, we're making two big changes,
[08:46] including a pretty big thematic change.
[08:49] So, let's see how well it handles that.
[08:51] Keep in mind, this is unedited other
[08:54] than like if I mess up, if I say
[08:56] something wrong, then maybe I'll say
[08:58] I'll edit that part out. But, um, these
[09:01] are not cherrypicked. These are kind of
[09:04] a almost live presentation. I'm doing
[09:06] this as we're going live. as far as I
[09:07] can tell so far is is everything's
[09:10] perfect and everything is grounded to
[09:13] the documents that I've that I've
[09:15] uploaded and everything is accurate.
[09:19] Everything responds as you would expect
[09:21] it to respond and so far it's looking
[09:23] good. Hey, that's looking pretty good, I
[09:27] got to say. Now, one thing to notice
[09:28] here is that you you can go granular,
[09:32] right? So, you can tweak the font, the
[09:33] size, the color, the alignment. You can
[09:35] do it manually or with the AI, but the
[09:38] really good thing is you don't have to.
[09:40] What's interesting is I think it noticed
[09:43] the fact that ah yes, the slides now
[09:45] have a sophisticated desert cantina
[09:48] aesthetic that perfectly matches the
[09:49] Moss Eley theme. So, it caught on to the
[09:52] fact of of of what we're doing, which is
[09:54] which is nice because I never explained
[09:57] what the cantina is. So, it picked it up
[09:59] in a context. And as you can see here as
[10:02] it's building it out, the theme I got to
[10:05] say this is kind of exactly what we
[10:08] wanted. Uh the contrasting colors,
[10:11] everything's very good. It's certainly a
[10:13] dark theme. I love it. Some of these
[10:16] charts are looking a little bit low
[10:17] contrast. So we're going to say for
[10:19] charts and graphs, let's use very high
[10:22] contrast colors and add some 3D
[10:24] elements. All right, let's see what it's
[10:26] coming up with. Boom. W Okay, that's
[10:29] very cool. It's got a little bit of a
[10:31] skewed element to it. Definitely very
[10:34] high contrast that's really popping out.
[10:37] Here's the other one. Yeah, as you can
[10:39] see, it's definitely has a little bit of
[10:40] a 3D element to it. All these things are
[10:43] popping up. Notice when I hover over
[10:45] these points, there's some more details
[10:47] that pop up. There's some transparency.
[10:49] I mean, it's looking really, really
[10:51] good. We got these charts and graphs.
[10:53] Yeah, these are looking great. Very high
[10:56] contrast colors, and you can see all of
[10:58] the segments separated. So we can hover
[11:00] over each segment individually. When
[11:02] you're done with your slide deck, you
[11:04] can record your walkthrough or export
[11:07] it. You can export it as a PDF or as a
[11:10] PowerPoint presentation. If you share
[11:12] the PowerPoint presentation, others can
[11:14] continue to create their own PowerPoint
[11:17] based on your conversation. But the
[11:19] point is you can focus on the story.
[11:22] Genpark handles all the visuals. So
[11:25] here's who this is for. For tech
[11:28] creators, you can ship explainer decks
[11:30] to pair with your videos. For educators,
[11:33] you can turn lesson plans or PDF into
[11:35] clean slides fast. For startup teams,
[11:38] you can do proposals, road maps, or
[11:40] investor updates in minutes. And for
[11:43] analysts and marketers, just paste your
[11:46] findings and data to create a clean,
[11:48] polished, client ready deck. So, if your
[11:51] bottleneck is creating the slides and
[11:53] not telling the story, Genparks AI
[11:56] slides is a gamecher. Try using my link
[11:58] in the first line of the description.
