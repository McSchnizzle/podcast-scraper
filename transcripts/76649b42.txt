[00:00] Now that's a high stakes meeting. They
[00:01] want something in their mind. Most
[00:03] productled or more salesled CEOs are
[00:05] very clear in terms of what they want.
[00:07] You wore this AI recording device in
[00:11] your meeting with your CEO. Basically
[00:13] recorded this meeting. Then you're just
[00:15] taking the transcript of that meeting
[00:18] and you are pasting it into chat GBT to
[00:21] generate this product. And at the end of
[00:23] this, you know, I have a fully
[00:24] functional now drag and drop canvas
[00:26] builder that could build a full entire
[00:28] user journey. And the goal here is not
[00:30] to say something is easy. It's more so
[00:33] to are they all aligned and can be more
[00:35] fast, which I think is the next
[00:36] superpower as all these tools come out
[00:39] and what could be possible.
[00:41] [Music]
[00:44] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vo,
[00:47] product leader and AI obsessive here on
[00:50] a mission to help you build better with
[00:51] these new tools. Today I have an episode
[00:54] that's both going to inspire product
[00:56] managers and CEOs and maybe strike some
[00:59] fear in the heart of product managers
[01:01] and engineers. I'm speaking to Anjan
[01:04] Paneer Selam, CPTO of Acolyte Health,
[01:07] who is using AI in every stakeholder
[01:10] interaction, giving customers access and
[01:13] free reign to all the prototypes on
[01:15] their road map and solving debates with
[01:18] engineering by building products. This
[01:21] is a fun episode. It tells us a lot
[01:23] about both tools and culture and I think
[01:25] it's a must listen for product
[01:27] engineering and startup executives out
[01:29] there. Let's get to it. This episode is
[01:32] brought to you by Notion. Notion is now
[01:34] your do everything AI tool for work.

[02:35] AI. Anjan, welcome to how I AI.
[02:39] Thank you so much, Claire. Very happy to
[02:41] be here. Big fan of everything that you
[02:43] do and also a big user of chat purity.
[02:46] So really thanks for putting it out
[02:48] there and helping a lot of us. Well,
[02:50] what I really like is you and I have
[02:53] something in common, which is we have
[02:55] this fairly rare but more common title
[02:59] CPTO,
[03:02] thinking and caring for the product and
[03:05] engineering organizations. And before we
[03:07] dive into your use cases, I'm curious
[03:09] how that specific point of view has
[03:11] really changed how you think about AI or
[03:15] how you've adopted AI inside your
[03:18] startup. For a long time I was jumping
[03:21] between CTO CPO and eventually I found
[03:23] this kind of um role and I think um it's
[03:27] really big thanks to AI that the roles
[03:29] are now starting to the lines are
[03:31] starting to blur for the roles and it's
[03:33] now one role um and you know early stage
[03:35] startups specifically love the CPTTO
[03:38] because they have one person to go ask
[03:41] everything to there's like no two people
[03:42] in the room now um and I think AI
[03:46] definitely has made it much more
[03:47] bearable and much more easier to manage
[03:50] the responsibilities that come with
[03:52] being being both responsible for the
[03:54] product and the technology side of
[03:56] things and most importantly it cuts down
[04:00] the time required to that's spent in
[04:02] transitioning ideas transitioning
[04:04] information and now directly goes into
[04:07] how things could be made possible. What
[04:09] I really like about this role is that
[04:11] you get rid of this false conflict
[04:14] between product and engineering, but
[04:16] unfortunately you do not get rid of I
[04:19] wouldn't call it a conflict, but the
[04:22] debates and negotiations that happen
[04:24] between the product and engineering team
[04:26] and the CEO. And so I would love to dive
[04:29] into your first uh workflow which is
[04:32] really about how to guide maybe an
[04:34] executive whether they're your CEO or
[04:37] another leader through an idea and
[04:40] really solicit out kind of use cases,
[04:43] user experience, all that stuff in a
[04:45] single meeting using AI. So let's dive
[04:47] into that.
[04:47] I work in B2B enterprise applications
[04:49] mostly. So um um a very simple idea that
[04:53] came up which I think um I've built this
[04:55] over the years like the last 17 years in
[04:57] my tech career five different startups
[04:59] I've built it at every startup and the
[05:01] timeline always shortened. First it took
[05:03] like 6 months then it took a few months
[05:05] then a few weeks but now it's like in a
[05:08] matter of 30 minutes to two days we're
[05:10] actually building it and also putting it
[05:12] into production and that's how fast it's
[05:14] become. So there's this one idea that's
[05:16] there's a problem that I love a lot. How
[05:18] can we build a user journey map within
[05:20] the application? So a lot of
[05:22] applications that I work on is where
[05:24] customers want to be able to tailor how
[05:26] the experience gets delivered to users.
[05:29] Normally this just imagine this if we
[05:31] had no logic we have to write down all
[05:33] the logic. A Figma designer has to go
[05:35] and design everything in Figma. Then
[05:37] they have to think through all the
[05:39] possibilities. Next engineering has to
[05:41] understand all the different
[05:42] permutations and combinations.
[05:44] Everything's written on document.
[05:46] impossible to think of how much has to
[05:48] be done before we can even have
[05:50] something functional. So in this case we
[05:53] are in a meeting um multiple
[05:54] stakeholders um and then the
[05:56] conversation comes up can we build like
[05:58] a journey builder within our
[05:59] application. So first step where I
[06:02] always start um I love starting with
[06:04] chat GPT because this kind of has become
[06:06] my brain dump of what I'm thinking
[06:08] through and then it helps me
[06:09] consolidate. Um so start here work
[06:12] through a very simple idea. So, I want
[06:15] to be able to build a prototype here.
[06:17] Very simple explanations, right? Natural
[06:18] language that we're just conversing.
[06:20] There's no complex like here's like a
[06:22] structured PRD or a structured
[06:23] statement. Just a pure brain dump of
[06:25] what everybody's talking.
[06:27] Yeah. One thing I'd like to call out
[06:29] here is, as much as I'd like to say, of
[06:32] course, that AI can do a lot of the
[06:34] product job, one thing that experienced
[06:36] product managers are very good at that
[06:38] you've shown you're good at is taking
[06:41] probably an idea from your CEO that's
[06:43] like, I want a journey builder. Like, I
[06:45] want people to be able to like build
[06:46] whatever journey they want. And you've
[06:48] actually given some pretty precise
[06:50] language to that. So there is still a
[06:52] job out there for us despite perhaps my
[06:56] my past um
[06:58] my past forecasts of the death of PM. I
[07:02] do think the ability to clearly
[07:04] articulate either for a human partner or
[07:07] AI something a little bit more specific
[07:10] which I think you've done here help you
[07:12] know a single page canvas userf facing
[07:13] tool map out personalized workflows like
[07:15] that's all very specific language that I
[07:17] think a great product manager can
[07:19] translate in very short order. So that's
[07:22] what you're putting into this prompt.
[07:24] And then what are you trying to get out
[07:25] of it? So out of this I want actually a
[07:28] simple structured um prompt that could
[07:30] go into another tool like Lovable Vzero
[07:33] or Magic Patterns any of those. Um and
[07:36] uh the idea here is I'm starting with
[07:38] something and AI does a great job of
[07:41] understanding what else is needed
[07:42] because I'm saying I want it to be a
[07:44] lovable prompt or a vzero prompt. AI
[07:46] understands what else might be needed.
[07:48] So as we go in it starts to summarize
[07:50] everything that's needed automatically
[07:52] picks like a pattern like it's a left
[07:54] side vertical toolbar that could have
[07:55] some and the great thing it does is AI
[07:59] helps normalize every good product
[08:01] managers uh product sense or product
[08:03] feeling into very structured
[08:05] information. So that's what typically
[08:07] differentiates different product
[08:08] managers they have each a different way
[08:10] of explaining how they want it. AI
[08:12] doesn't judge you. It's like okay I get
[08:14] it and I'm going to help you. And I
[08:15] think this is where the biggest shift
[08:17] has been even product managers who
[08:20] initially want to think a lot. My push
[08:22] always to them is just jump in and start
[08:24] typing. Don't think about what anybody's
[08:27] going to think, what AI is going to
[08:28] think because it's very kind, very nice.
[08:30] Just jump in, start putting in. So one
[08:33] prompt later, not even too complex, we
[08:35] have a very nice prompt that I could
[08:37] then use um you know um into lovable orb
[08:40] zero. So from here that's all straight
[08:43] goes to um directly we go into LAR v0ero
[08:46] we put it in and start convers um start
[08:49] building the prototype. One thing I want
[08:51] to also mention here is it's not just
[08:54] limited to um something I type here um I
[08:57] wanted to actually show in this use case
[08:59] I was using the limitless pendant um
[09:01] something I was just experimenting with.
[09:03] This is actually live transcript that's
[09:05] coming from the conversation that we're
[09:07] having in the room. And I could go from
[09:09] this directly into chat GPT as well. So,
[09:12] helps normalize it. Or this could be a
[09:14] copy.
[09:15] I have to I have to pause you. I have to
[09:16] pause you. Do you have the Limitless
[09:17] Pendant right now? Do you have it close?
[09:20] Yeah, I have.
[09:20] Wait, you got to you got to show it.
[09:21] Show it to us.
[09:22] Give me one sec. I'm just
[09:24] Yeah. Yeah. Um, while you're while
[09:25] you're looking um at it or looking for
[09:28] it, I have to shout out my old pal Dan
[09:31] um who's the CEO and founder of
[09:33] Limitless and we'll be thrilled to see
[09:37] um the pendant in real life.
[09:39] Yep. This is my Limitless pendant. Um I
[09:43] was actually one of the first few people
[09:44] to pre-order this.
[09:46] Um I I worked with pendants my entire
[09:49] life because I used to work in senior
[09:50] living. So we used to build like the
[09:52] medical alert buttons. So when this form
[09:55] factor came on I'm like I'm trying this
[09:56] and this has been like such a gamecher
[10:00] especially like you know you're sitting
[10:02] in a coffee shop you're talking with you
[10:04] know stakeholders partners colleagues
[10:06] ideas flow right there should be no
[10:08] friction oh let me take a paper and
[10:09] write it down oh let me remember it so
[10:12] this just completely changed the game
[10:14] there so this is like transcript for
[10:15] example from a meeting we start here and
[10:18] then directly go into AI so
[10:20] straightforward and simple so thanks for
[10:22] building
[10:25] Thanks. Thanks, Dan and other friends
[10:27] over at Limitless. I have to say, you
[10:30] did not tell me about the Limitless
[10:31] pendant in our prep. And this has been a
[10:33] how I AI first. So, just to recap for
[10:36] folks that are maybe not watching or
[10:38] don't know what this pendant is. Um, you
[10:41] wore this basically AI recording device
[10:46] in your meeting with your CEO, I'm sure.
[10:49] um ascribing to all applicable
[10:51] disclosure laws about about recording.
[10:53] Of course, of course, of course. Yes.
[10:55] And you basically recorded this meeting
[10:57] and then that's streaming into the
[10:58] Limitless AI app. Then you're just
[11:01] taking the transcript of that meeting
[11:04] and you are pasting it into chat GBT to
[11:07] generate this prompt. We totally buried
[11:09] the lead on the like new how I AI
[11:12] workflow here. So again, it'll be
[11:14] interesting to see. I think we've seen a
[11:16] lot of, you know, desktop driven meeting
[11:19] recording apps. Um, it'll be really
[11:22] interesting to see as these like
[11:23] wearables and devices come into the
[11:25] workplace, right,
[11:26] how that might shift. And I just had to
[11:28] ask you, you know, why why the pendant?
[11:31] Why a hardware device or or wearable
[11:34] versus like turning on something like
[11:36] granola or another meeting recording
[11:38] kind of um product?
[11:41] I think, you know, sometimes you want it
[11:42] to be non-intrusive. I think that's, you
[11:45] know, um I'm I'm a big fan of also the
[11:47] Meta Glasses. I'm waiting for better
[11:49] versions, lighter versions to come out,
[11:51] but this this is such such a
[11:53] non-intrusive device. Has amazing
[11:55] transcription. Um and the great thing is
[11:58] it's not limited by language, too. So,
[12:00] you know, sometimes we have voice
[12:02] recorders. You have to open your phone.
[12:04] You have to set it on the table. Oh, let
[12:05] me make sure I do it. So, that's not
[12:07] always possible. When you're talking,
[12:09] you just want to talk. You're thinking
[12:10] through and you're naturally conversing.
[12:13] So, it does a great that that's one, you
[12:16] know, great reason why I think I'm very
[12:18] bullish about hardware um that's going
[12:21] to carry AI and, you know, it's going to
[12:23] completely change what's possible.
[12:25] Okay, quick quick request for folks
[12:27] watching or listening in the comments,
[12:29] if you are also a hardware afficionado
[12:32] or have a use case around that, I would
[12:34] love to hear from you. Um I too love the
[12:36] meta the meta glasses. They are my daily
[12:39] drivers for um headphones and things
[12:41] like that and I would love to hear more
[12:42] about how people are using um hardware
[12:44] on how I AI because this has been a
[12:47] first. Okay.
[12:48] Yes.
[12:48] So side detour through through recording
[12:50] but you're basically taking these
[12:52] meeting transcripts in the meeting.
[12:54] You're saying great, let's get it to a
[12:55] prototype. And then you're getting it
[12:56] into lovable, for example. And this is
[13:00] an example of what you're getting out of
[13:02] it, which is this nice, beautiful
[13:04] workflow builder with a lefth hand kind
[13:06] of card nav, which we had seen in the
[13:09] prompt, and some interactivity, I
[13:11] suppose.
[13:12] Yep. Um, fully interactive. So here now,
[13:15] I started with um, you know, this prompt
[13:17] in uh, Chad GPT. As I thought through
[13:20] this, and again, this is one of the
[13:22] great things, right? when you're doing
[13:23] product and technology, you're
[13:24] constantly thinking of how this idea is
[13:27] going to evolve. So, chat GPT gave me a
[13:30] good starting point. I then b into
[13:32] lovable and as I was pasting and I'm
[13:34] adding few more points there. So, hey, I
[13:36] remembered I, you know, ran into a
[13:39] library called React Flow that does
[13:40] great job at making like a canvas-based
[13:43] builder. So, I put that in here. And I
[13:45] did not expect Lovable to know what
[13:47] React Flow is. There's always this like,
[13:49] oh, maybe it doesn't know. But AI always
[13:52] surprises me here. Somehow they it it
[13:54] knew React flow and exactly that's what
[13:56] it went ahead to implement and you know
[13:59] u one of the things I always recommend
[14:01] is break down your concepts for AI and
[14:04] you'll have a lot more success. So I
[14:06] broke it down first starting with the
[14:08] basic idea and slowly as things progress
[14:10] keep building on it. Um, and at the end
[14:13] of this, you know, I have a fully
[14:15] functional now drag and drop canvas
[14:18] builder that could build a full entire
[14:20] user journey. And this, as I mentioned,
[14:23] I've I've built this so many times in my
[14:25] career. And it has literally been like
[14:28] 17, 18 page documents that fully
[14:30] summarize what's possible. pencil
[14:32] sketches, then then UX designers go put
[14:34] it in Figma, all of that stuff, which
[14:37] which is still okay to do now, but I
[14:39] think nobody wants to spend time reading
[14:41] 17 pages and then arriving at a
[14:43] conclusion. They would rather see. And
[14:46] this this exactly does that. So very
[14:48] easy to do and most importantly talk
[14:51] about. So just imagine going to your
[14:53] engineering team, you're not giving them
[14:54] an 18page document, but you're rather
[14:56] standing, let me show a demo of what I'm
[14:58] thinking. Now we're moving from oh let's
[15:02] spend a week aligning to here's the
[15:04] alignment in less than 30 minutes to an
[15:06] hour. And it's the same with the CEO
[15:08] too. Now that's a high stakes meeting.
[15:10] They want something in their mind and
[15:12] they're very you know u most productled
[15:14] or more salesled CEOs are very clear in
[15:16] terms of what they want. They might not
[15:18] explain it always but now here they are
[15:20] visually seeing this and they might say
[15:22] you know what I want something else here
[15:24] that'll make it possible. So, for
[15:26] example, I don't want too many variables
[15:28] or I want to be able to edit each part
[15:30] of whatever block that you have. And
[15:33] that's the great thing with these
[15:34] prototypes that we generate. Everything
[15:36] is editable. It's no longer just static
[15:38] images that like, okay, let me put it on
[15:40] a board and explain it. It's fully
[15:42] explanatory. It's fully interactive. And
[15:44] then we go from this to first alignment
[15:47] with the stakeholders, which is like the
[15:49] leaders of the business. Everybody's on
[15:51] the page. Let's now move on to the next
[15:53] step. So
[15:54] yeah, I I really love this. I want to
[15:56] call out a couple things for folks that
[15:58] are listening or maybe not watching. One
[16:00] is this is really it looks great and
[16:04] Lovable's been a wonderful sponsor of
[16:05] the show, so I have to have to shout
[16:07] them out. We do love them. And I do tend
[16:10] to pick Lovable when I want something to
[16:12] look nice, you know, like it tends to be
[16:16] out of the box,
[16:17] you know, it it uses color
[16:18] intelligently. it has it tends to have
[16:21] you know kind of beautiful pretty modern
[16:23] user experience. So I do tend to pick
[16:26] this particular tool for something like
[16:28] this especially where visual design is a
[16:31] differentiator. I think you know
[16:33] sometimes people ask me what what
[16:34] prototyping tool should I pick and
[16:36] you're probably like me it's like well
[16:38] which whichever one I feel like is going
[16:40] to do the job of the day and you know
[16:42] when I need something that uh where UX
[16:44] is maybe a little bit of the
[16:45] differentiator or it's highly
[16:47] interactive like data visualizations or
[16:49] a workflow builder
[16:51] I've also found that lovable does quite
[16:53] quite a nice job. So that's one thing I
[16:55] wanted to call out. The second thing is,
[16:58] you know, I I did a little little tour
[17:00] in healthcare once and these rules
[17:03] builders, flow builders are like
[17:05] everybody's built one or they built 10.
[17:08] Yeah.
[17:08] And what's really hard for a product
[17:10] manager is in the past is you're exactly
[17:12] right. You have to sit there and write
[17:14] bullet points for every piece of logic,
[17:17] every customizable field. You have to go
[17:20] in here and say, "Okay, if I send an
[17:21] SMS, I have to check that the SMS has
[17:24] been like opted in. I can't send too
[17:27] many SMSs in a row." Like, you have to
[17:29] do all this logic.
[17:30] It's very hard to document. It's very
[17:33] hard to test. And what I like about
[17:36] prototypes as sort of the source of
[17:38] truth for something that is this complex
[17:41] is you can actually just click through
[17:42] and go, "Oh, you're not supposed to put
[17:44] two SMS components in a row. That goes
[17:47] back into the prototype code." or you
[17:49] know you shouldn't do a delay on a delay
[17:51] and so I think these are particularly
[17:53] effective for highly complex products
[17:57] because the alignment on the
[17:58] requirements and the testing becomes
[18:00] much more natural it's very unnatural to
[18:02] read rule sets um it's much more natural
[18:06] to interact with something something
[18:08] like this so I think it's a really
[18:10] effective tool and then the third thing
[18:11] I want to call out that in case people
[18:13] missed because they're going to be very
[18:14] mad at you they're like oh no you've
[18:16] given my CEO the idea one, I can get a
[18:19] prototype in 30 minutes. Two, that I can
[18:21] ship it in two days. But I actually
[18:23] think the thing that you called out was
[18:25] really important, which is
[18:27] those are high stakes meetings and
[18:28] they're high stakes products when your
[18:29] CEO is asking for something.
[18:31] And the worst thing is you say, "Okay,
[18:34] I'm going to come back here two or three
[18:35] weeks and show it to you." And you show
[18:37] it to them and it's totally wrong.
[18:38] They're like, "No, that is not at all
[18:40] what I wanted.
[18:42] Not at all what I was thinking. Um, the
[18:44] team is angry. the CEO is frustrated, no
[18:47] one feels good. And so this is like a
[18:49] cheap path to failure, too, which is
[18:52] like if you get this and CEO is like,
[18:54] she's like, "No, not it." Um, it it cost
[18:59] you what, 15 minutes. It's not a big not
[19:01] a big deal. Move on with your life. So,
[19:04] I think those three things are worth
[19:05] worth noting in this particular
[19:06] workflow. But let's go to what you were
[19:08] talking about next, which is great. We
[19:12] have we have something like this. You
[19:14] know, CEO is going to be like, "When can
[19:15] I have it?" And sales is going to be
[19:16] like, "When can I sell it, right?"
[19:18] And a product manager is going to ask
[19:20] their favorite question, which is why?
[19:22] Like, do people actually want this? So,
[19:24] exactly.
[19:25] Um, how do you do kind of testing? I'm
[19:27] I'm curious what what the next part of
[19:29] your flow is,
[19:30] right? So, next part from here is three
[19:32] things. Um, I try to put together some
[19:35] slides. Um, thanks GMA here or gamma.
[19:38] The same prompt that we were just using.
[19:40] Um I start here um with the chat um same
[19:44] chat GPD prompt whatever came out I go
[19:47] and iterate on this. So the next
[19:49] question um and again all of this can be
[19:51] done with a custom GPD tool that you can
[19:53] build for yourself but I think um the
[19:56] new models have gotten good where it
[19:58] understands what your persona is where
[20:00] you're asking from. So we don't even
[20:02] have to go through that effort anymore.
[20:04] I just start like I want to be able to
[20:05] do some market research. Can you now
[20:07] make this a little bit better? I can put
[20:09] it into perplexity or do some research
[20:12] um on it. So that's the next step that I
[20:14] start here try to build a very simple
[20:16] just statement of what we're trying to
[20:18] do what is a little bit more about the
[20:21] actual use cases what the customer types
[20:23] are. So on one side I can use the same
[20:26] prompt go into perplexity this
[20:28] particular use case that I just did. So
[20:30] here one of the great things to do is
[20:32] deep research um which cuts down the
[20:34] time analysis time by like 3 brings it
[20:37] down to 3 minutes from whatever it used
[20:39] to take. Um I think I think the main
[20:41] advantage with a lot of this is it
[20:43] reduces the immediate emotional or
[20:46] cognitive burden on product managers or
[20:48] leaders um in general to focus on what
[20:51] makes strategic value and forget about
[20:53] every other thing that's involved. So if
[20:55] we have to do an analysis, every product
[20:58] manager has their way of what all they
[20:59] want to analyze, put into a competitive
[21:01] matrix or any of this. We get past all
[21:03] of that. That's what deep research for
[21:05] example in this case does for us. We
[21:07] give it some information. Again, as I
[21:09] come in here, I put in some more
[21:10] information. I want to build a market
[21:12] analysis on the following feature I'm
[21:13] working on. Paste the rest of the
[21:15] prompt. It goes and builds everything
[21:17] that's needed as a starting point. So
[21:19] review this. So now your market analysis
[21:22] to a certain extent is done. This is
[21:24] again to build conviction within first
[21:26] the PM or the technology leader that I
[21:29] want I know what I'm working on is of
[21:31] meaningful value and I can monetize it.
[21:34] Very important in an early stage startup
[21:35] even in late stage but I think even more
[21:37] important early stage because if we're
[21:39] not seeing ROI immediately that's more
[21:41] money we're burning building products
[21:43] that don't generate immediate ROI. So
[21:46] once that's done um exported as a PDF or
[21:49] goes into kind of gamma from here build
[21:52] very basic slides uh makes it look
[21:54] pretty. So when we're talking to other
[21:56] PMs, other stakeholders, it's like work
[21:59] is already done that immediately you
[22:01] know attracts them makes them bring to
[22:04] the understanding that we have thought
[22:05] this through which is true which is all
[22:07] happening in our minds but now AI is
[22:09] helping implement it and then very basic
[22:12] slides to be able to talk through um
[22:14] talks about what are competitive
[22:15] advantages strategic benefits and then
[22:18] what the product is supposed to do.

[23:06] That's lovable.dev.
[23:09] One of the things that I find
[23:10] challenging working with AI um exciting
[23:13] and challenging is AI has tends to have
[23:15] an abundance mindset in that it tends to
[23:18] think all my ideas are great and
[23:20] everything is opportunity. And so I'm
[23:23] curious if you've gotten a critical
[23:25] market analysis out of AI or if it's
[23:28] always sort of seeking the data that
[23:30] tells you something is a good idea
[23:32] versus figuring out reasons why it might
[23:35] not work or it's not the right
[23:36] investment. And I'm curious what your
[23:37] experience has been there.
[23:38] Yeah. Uh I I mean one of the things
[23:40] always as you said AI is bullish about
[23:42] everything that needs to happen. So I
[23:45] think some follow-ups are critical here.
[23:47] So in Perplexity for example when I'm
[23:49] doing it I always have a follow-up at
[23:51] the end saying can you play devil's
[23:53] advocate and tell me if it's really
[23:54] worth it or can you um do you see really
[23:57] value in any of this? In other words, if
[24:00] you're going to ask AI once more to just
[24:02] make sure it is right, it is going to be
[24:05] accurate then to say compare it to all
[24:07] of these other things that are
[24:08] generated. I think this is the reasons
[24:10] why it might be unique. And a procon
[24:12] analysis is again so easy, right? So you
[24:14] could just build it into your prompt or
[24:16] ask it. And I'll tell you there are more
[24:19] features that AI has helped me say no to
[24:22] because it's all in front of me and the
[24:25] data is readily available which I think
[24:27] is again what is the most critical
[24:28] right? You want to save your time for
[24:30] the ones that are really valuable,
[24:33] really meaningful, but now you're no
[24:35] longer carrying the burden that oh my
[24:37] god, I spent 3 weeks working on this
[24:38] just to say no. It's done in an hour.
[24:41] And now you can feel more, you know, you
[24:43] can more freely say no to things and
[24:44] only focus on the things that are
[24:46] important. So I think it goes back to
[24:48] the earlier point you mentioned to good
[24:50] product sense is still critical. Product
[24:52] managers are still critical. It doesn't
[24:54] replace PMs or what they do. it just
[24:56] makes them to focus on what the outcomes
[24:59] to be rather than the entire process. So
[25:02] that's that's that's where I have seen
[25:04] it be useful and helpful.
[25:06] Okay. So in our stakeholder Olympics,
[25:08] you have you know crossed the hurdle of
[25:11] the CEO. We've got the CEO excited. You
[25:13] made a deck. So now all the product
[25:15] managers and executives are you a deck
[25:18] with numbers. That's the thing that
[25:19] makes product managers and executives
[25:21] happy.
[25:22] What what's your next stakeholder you go
[25:24] after? um more details, right? So,
[25:27] there's always going to be a junior PM
[25:29] or the engineering leader who's going to
[25:31] ask, "Okay, tell me more. Um I want to
[25:33] know what exactly you mean by this."
[25:36] This is where chat PRD is like extremely
[25:38] great for me because I use chat purity
[25:40] almost like a gate to to the point that
[25:43] you mentioned. Are you sure you want to
[25:45] do this? Are you sure you have
[25:46] everything? That's where I find the tool
[25:48] to be extremely helpful because while
[25:50] chat GPD is there, it's a generic unless
[25:52] you give it like a huge persona overload
[25:54] of what it needs to do. It's very
[25:56] generic. But chat purity on the other
[25:58] side is geared towards a requirements
[26:00] document or a product sense um that
[26:03] needs to be validated. And this is where
[26:05] I use the same prompt, but now rather
[26:07] than chat purity going and saying let me
[26:09] generate everything for you just because
[26:11] you asked me, it goes through a series
[26:13] of validations. Have you thought through
[26:14] this? Have you t thought about what
[26:17] could be the disadvantages if you're
[26:18] building something? Do you have any
[26:20] specific inspirations?
[26:22] This is where I find chat PR
[26:24] specifically helpful. Um I have a
[26:26] template that I've built for myself. Um
[26:28] I call it like the CPTO stack where
[26:31] there is a particular type of uh PRD
[26:34] that my team likes. So I sat with them,
[26:36] discussed with them, came to alignment
[26:38] and then I went forward. Now I validate
[26:41] all the questions here. This is kind of
[26:43] core as or the last step before it's
[26:45] handed over to the engineering
[26:46] counterparts. Now they're going to spend
[26:47] actual mental time thinking through the
[26:49] details. So all of it is done. It goes
[26:52] through a series of discussions and we
[26:55] have now a fully functional PRD. Um easy
[26:58] to read, very small bullet points, no
[27:00] large paragraphs, no large tickets yet.
[27:04] And then it's now ready. And this is one
[27:07] that caught me by surprise. This future
[27:09] ideas and enhancements, right? So this
[27:11] is something I've been dumping into the
[27:12] chats as I go through chat GPT
[27:15] perplexity all of it but chat did a good
[27:18] job of pulling this separately what are
[27:20] feature ideas and enhancements what
[27:21] could be possible almost like a teaser
[27:23] to let your engineering team know hey
[27:25] I'm going to come back with a v2 that's
[27:27] going to be all this too but it's a very
[27:31] subtle hint that gets their you know uh
[27:34] creative juices flowing and I think uh
[27:36] makes makes the job easier
[27:38] it's a it's a very strange experience
[27:40] experience as a as a founder or as a
[27:42] product person to have somebody explain
[27:44] your own product back to you. But I will
[27:46] say for folks that have not experienced
[27:48] this product that I made. It really is
[27:50] just a replica of going through a
[27:52] product review with me, my poor my poor
[27:54] product teams, which is I've done so
[27:57] many like what we call be called PRDR.
[27:59] We have a little song. It's like PR
[28:01] PRDR. Um it's very fun. But we have this
[28:04] product requirements design or a product
[28:06] requirements document review meeting.
[28:08] And I just found myself consistently
[28:10] asking like who else is doing this?
[28:12] Well, are there other products that we
[28:14] we like here? What's next? Like is this
[28:16] V0? If this is V 0, what's V1? Vitz B2
[28:20] and I do think this idea of using AI no
[28:22] matter what your function is as a gate
[28:26] to make sure that you've checked all the
[28:28] boxes of the next step without having to
[28:31] go to your boss or having to go to
[28:33] you know your other stakeholders is is a
[28:35] really effective way to sort of bring AI
[28:37] into the loop um in a way that
[28:39] ultimately saves everybody time
[28:41] right yep definitely and I think you
[28:44] know the one thing I would love which
[28:47] you're building already is integration
[28:48] So from here it goes now to v 0 which
[28:51] makes the job a lot more easier to keep
[28:53] iterating and refining. But I think as
[28:55] time progresses more tools become
[28:57] integrated. It's going to be a big game
[28:59] changer for everything PMs and CTOs are
[29:02] doing um dayto-day.
[29:03] Yeah I'm I'm sorry to the engineers out
[29:05] there but we will be building a Ajira
[29:08] integration to turn all of this into
[29:10] tickets. Um sad sad to say. Okay, so
[29:12] you've gotten again through a couple key
[29:14] stakeholders, your CEO, your PM cohort,
[29:17] your AI CPTO here in chat PRD,
[29:22] you know, let's get to customers. What
[29:23] do we do when we want to actually get
[29:25] this in the hands of customers and
[29:27] validate it? What's your next AIdriven
[29:29] next step?
[29:30] Yeah, so customers access teams love
[29:32] this as well. So we built what is almost
[29:35] called like a living product library or
[29:37] demo library of pages especially which
[29:39] are like close to the design language of
[29:41] our actual platform and have these all
[29:44] as individual micro sites that we
[29:45] deployed. So now um either sales teams
[29:49] or customer success teams because it's
[29:50] intuitive there's no you know um there's
[29:52] no places where it's going to fail
[29:54] suddenly or I can't click because the
[29:56] Figma interaction was not done. No
[29:58] challenges of that nature. They have now
[30:01] the flexibility to be able to completely
[30:03] take this and show it to customers, get
[30:05] real-time feedback. So, they're no
[30:07] longer worried about how to navigate.
[30:08] This is a fully interactive prototype.
[30:10] So, in this situation, as soon as I
[30:13] built this, um it was so funny. We had a
[30:15] stakeholder meeting in one meeting room.
[30:17] 30 minutes later, we're with the
[30:18] customer actually demoing this because,
[30:21] you know, they wanted to see it. And
[30:24] what would have taken again like 2 3
[30:26] months of discussions going back and
[30:28] forth, especially if they're a high
[30:29] stakes customer is now done almost
[30:32] immediately. And it does two things,
[30:33] right? Customers see it, they align and
[30:35] say, you know what, this would be really
[30:36] helpful for me. They're no longer
[30:38] reviewing slides. They're no longer
[30:40] having to just listen to long talks
[30:42] about what a product could do. They're
[30:44] seeing what it's going to be. And if
[30:46] they don't like something, they're right
[30:48] there telling us, you know what, I think
[30:49] something could be different. And I
[30:51] think the outcome of all of this is like
[30:53] extremely fast alignment which in my
[30:55] view is kind of what is super critical
[30:57] now as long as you're aligned with your
[31:00] stakeholders with your customers
[31:02] building anything else is easier is more
[31:04] tangible because there is no longer an
[31:07] uncertaintity of okay let me put it into
[31:09] build will this work or not so that's
[31:12] what we do next take it to customers
[31:13] show them anybody on the team can do it
[31:15] even I could trust my CEO to do it
[31:17] because you know it's a demo library
[31:19] it's restricted to that there's no page
[31:21] he has to go to where it's like suddenly
[31:23] going to give a 404. So all of it is
[31:26] very well bounded and this living demo
[31:29] library keeps growing and you know um it
[31:33] most importantly doesn't put any burden
[31:35] on the engineering team which is what I
[31:36] love about being a CBTO. I can almost do
[31:39] my entire product function without
[31:41] worrying the engineering team. Oh please
[31:43] build this demo two days time one day
[31:45] time. I just want this one button to
[31:47] work. It's all now gone.
[31:50] Well, and so I think this is worth
[31:52] repeating because I think it's both very
[31:54] inspirational and also is going to give
[31:56] a whole bunch of teams a big heart
[31:58] attack. And so the thing that you've
[32:00] done here is you've taken not just this
[32:01] prototype, but basically your library of
[32:05] good ideas, fairly highfidelity
[32:07] prototypes. You've put them in a kind of
[32:10] companywide live demo library.
[32:14] So, anybody has access to these links
[32:16] and then you're like customer se success
[32:19] go ahead like sales go ahead CEOs go
[32:22] ahead and I know that you work for a
[32:24] relatively small company and so that
[32:26] cultural change is a little easier for
[32:28] you but I see so many product teams
[32:31] being like oh my god don't don't tell
[32:33] customers we're working on this or don't
[32:35] show them the Figma it's not going to be
[32:36] like that and I do think it's worth
[32:39] reconsidering
[32:41] how tightly we hold product ideas in the
[32:44] product organization and I do think
[32:46] you're showing a different model which
[32:47] is customers are understanding that
[32:50] things are in prototype phase and
[32:51] they're not live yet.
[32:53] Your team is intelligent and capable
[32:55] enough to manage customer expectations
[32:57] around things that may or may not come
[32:59] soon or later and it's overall better
[33:02] for the product. It's overall better for
[33:04] the teams and it's overall better for
[33:06] customers to just see what we're working
[33:09] on versus kind of keep it keep it
[33:12] secret. And so I think the AI side of
[33:14] this is interesting because it becomes
[33:16] cheap to sort of show customers stuff
[33:18] which I have also worked in the past
[33:21] where sales needs a demo of this or a
[33:23] prototype of that and you're scrambling
[33:25] two or three engineers to just try to
[33:26] make something happen. That's not great.
[33:28] So now you've changed the cost of that.
[33:30] But then you've also changed the culture
[33:33] around just being more generous with
[33:36] showing your road map, showing your
[33:37] prototype, showing your things things to
[33:39] customers. And so I think it's something
[33:41] that folks generally should consider is
[33:43] going to become a shift in how product
[33:45] and sales teams work together and I
[33:49] think you're totally leading leading the
[33:51] way here in terms of collaboration and
[33:52] openness.
[33:53] Yep. Yep. Yeah. That's totally the
[33:56] product and sales collaboration. You
[33:57] know um I had uh my all my previous
[34:00] sales leaders always said like if only
[34:02] you could show me what's possible I can
[34:04] make this happen. So for the longest
[34:06] time what was friction it could easily
[34:09] now be converted to a partnership and I
[34:11] think that's where AI is playing a big
[34:13] role how can you reduce friction across
[34:15] different teams how can you make the
[34:17] impossible possible and you know
[34:20] yeah and one thing I want to say which
[34:22] is probably the fear in the back of
[34:24] product team's minds or engineering
[34:26] team's minds is they say if I give this
[34:28] to sales and a customer likes it I'm
[34:30] going to be asked to build it like I'm
[34:33] going to be stressed because all of a
[34:34] sudden we're going to have demand and I
[34:36] as a product leader I will tell you this
[34:37] this is before AI I have always said
[34:40] wouldn't that be a great problem to have
[34:42] like wouldn't it be a great problem to
[34:44] have that a customer wants to buy
[34:46] something so much for us that there's
[34:49] like demand on our time to build
[34:51] something very specific I'm like the
[34:53] most likely outcome of all of this is a
[34:55] customer looks at it and goes eh like
[34:57] maybe you know like they're like eh kind
[35:00] of and I just I think people are so
[35:02] afraid of preserving
[35:04] product energy and engineering energy
[35:07] that they forget that those are like
[35:08] what I call rich people problems. Like
[35:10] having too many customers ask you for
[35:12] too much product is like the best
[35:14] problem a product manager can have.
[35:16] Yeah.
[35:16] And so I love this idea of just like
[35:18] getting in there and creating that
[35:20] problem for yourself which is ultimately
[35:22] a good one
[35:23] right I mean I like it's almost like you
[35:26] would rather have this prototype and
[35:27] alignment rather than randomly finding
[35:30] it on a quote that has already been
[35:31] signed and executed. Right?
[35:34] Okay, you're you're talking about the
[35:35] other thing, which is the well, I had to
[35:37] close it for Q1, right? Uh feature
[35:40] feature commit uh tied to to revenue
[35:43] recognition, which you know, as as a
[35:45] good old B2B girl. I have been I have
[35:47] been there. I've been there as well.
[35:50] We've all been there. Okay, great. So,
[35:52] you're not only you as a product manager
[35:54] getting this front of customers, but you
[35:57] are letting your team get this in front
[35:59] of customers. Um, so I think you've
[36:02] you've managed stakeholders. It all
[36:04] sounds great. It sounds lovely to me,
[36:05] but we know there's still there's still
[36:08] conflicts, there's still debates. So
[36:10] tell me a little bit more about how
[36:12] you're breaking deadlocks with with AI.
[36:15] Yeah. So one one other situation where
[36:18] um we we we ran into a particular
[36:22] challenge was an idea um again that is
[36:26] where it required almost like a mobile
[36:28] app to be built. Um and the whole idea
[36:30] there was we have this concept could it
[36:34] work and now we have never done it for
[36:37] mobile there is no mobile developer on
[36:38] the team and now the team is stuck
[36:40] engineering is like nope I don't want to
[36:42] even hear about this don't even tell me
[36:43] about this and all we want to do is okay
[36:46] can we validate if it's possible rather
[36:49] than like going hiring that's the first
[36:51] step to do before we even start
[36:52] something so what we did in this
[36:55] situation was um a particular use case
[36:58] again um to kind of also show that there
[37:00] is no limit to what could be possible.
[37:02] Um is where we went into building a
[37:05] mobile app. Um this was an idea where we
[37:08] specifically wanted to be able to
[37:10] capture and just a selfie of a person.
[37:13] And we were working with avatars. So we
[37:15] want to be able to test Cappy, capture
[37:17] them in a happy way, in a sad way, in a
[37:20] normal way. And one of the big
[37:22] challenges we saw was enterprise
[37:25] customers or enterprise laptops always
[37:27] don't have the best webcam. So now how
[37:29] do we bring the solution to the customer
[37:32] with whatever they have rather than
[37:34] shipping expensive kits. So we're like
[37:37] okay mobile phones are always great the
[37:39] cameras are great. Now how do we build
[37:41] something very quick? So this is where
[37:43] again ROR comes into play. Um I think uh
[37:46] they're an underdog in this game or a
[37:48] lot of people are using it. Um but when
[37:50] I found it I was like okay this is like
[37:52] another frontier completely unlocked
[37:54] because what was previously not possible
[37:56] was mobile apps with generative AI. So
[37:59] same prompt right um similar concept
[38:01] started with chat GPT um a discussion in
[38:04] a coffee room where they're like okay
[38:06] what if we bring the mobile experience
[38:08] to the customers and have them just
[38:10] capture an avatar. I'm like, "Sure." And
[38:12] then I go off 10 minutes later, just one
[38:15] prompt here, we're able to now have a
[38:17] fully functional iOS app um or like an
[38:20] Expo app that does only two things,
[38:23] right? This is not a production app
[38:25] again, but it does the main thing of
[38:27] building something that you could test
[38:28] on your phones now and shows what could
[38:31] be possible. And this is where a little
[38:34] bit of sensitiveness is critical, too.
[38:35] Um, which requires understanding what
[38:38] engineering needs. We're not saying
[38:39] engineering here, I built it. I think
[38:41] that's not the right explanation to this
[38:43] or what we're doing here. It's more
[38:45] about it's possible. I think let's look
[38:47] at what is required to take this to
[38:49] production. So now this deadlock where
[38:51] there is a lack of knowledge of what
[38:53] could be possible is suddenly lifted to
[38:56] say here's what could be possible. Could
[38:58] we explore more? Right.
[39:00] Okay.
[39:02] So I I'm laughing because I and I'm
[39:05] making this face. Usually when I'm
[39:07] excited, I make this face, but I'm
[39:08] making I'm making this face, which is I
[39:11] I love this. This is like Clairvo
[39:14] playbook. No lanes, like do whatever you
[39:17] want. Sure, why don't we ship the CEO's
[39:20] idea? Like, yes, let's show it to like
[39:23] let's give it to sales. And everything
[39:26] you're recommending, I can see the flip
[39:28] side of like a product manager being
[39:30] like, why in the world would you give
[39:32] the CEO a prototype? Why in the world
[39:34] would you tell sales we can do that? And
[39:36] then an engineer be like, great, this
[39:38] guy just like whipped up a mobile app
[39:41] and told me that he can code something
[39:42] that I can't code. And what I want to
[39:44] call out here is you know your
[39:47] intentions and you know some someone
[39:50] like me that's really AI trying to adopt
[39:52] AI like our intentions are good which is
[39:55] there are sort of these like artificial
[39:57] rules and blocks that we in
[39:59] organizations have put into place like
[40:02] you're supposed to argue with the CEO
[40:03] about the road map. You're supposed to
[40:05] never overpromise to sales. You're
[40:07] supposed to like trust that engineering
[40:10] will always tell you what's possible and
[40:12] what's not possible. And the reality is
[40:15] like we're all human. We're limited in
[40:18] cognitive capacity. We have good days.
[40:20] We have bad days. We have experience. We
[40:23] lack experience in places. And there's
[40:25] just so much more access now to overcome
[40:29] those like misunderstandings,
[40:31] get more creative, be more inspired. And
[40:34] so, you know, what I would encourage
[40:36] folks to maybe take away from this or
[40:38] what I'm taking away is one, there's a
[40:40] different way you can show up to your
[40:42] team and it may like it may frazzle them
[40:44] a little bit, but I think on the net,
[40:47] it's pretty inspiring and very
[40:49] generative and you can see how this is
[40:51] going to deliver real value for
[40:53] customers first and then I would say on
[40:55] the other side of the table, let's be
[40:57] gentle, friends, which is like
[40:59] yes,
[41:00] I think people that are trying these new
[41:01] tools and trying these new technologies
[41:03] you know, like you maybe like me are
[41:06] genuinely builders, like genuinely get
[41:10] excited about creating solutions,
[41:13] genuinely want to solve problems. And
[41:16] so, it's not about threatening people's
[41:18] expertise or, you know, trying to take
[41:20] their role or questioning them. It's
[41:22] really about like, I think this could be
[41:24] pretty cool to build for our customers.
[41:25] I think this would be great for our
[41:26] users and I've found something that
[41:29] maybe can inspire us to do that. And so
[41:31] I think there's like a very important
[41:33] cultural takeaway from this episode that
[41:36] I don't want people to miss. In addition
[41:38] to I got to call out. Um I have not used
[41:40] ROR. So now you can AI prototype mobile
[41:43] apps. Did not know. Now I know. Um to
[41:45] kind of figure out things that are
[41:47] possible with consumer devices. So I I
[41:49] appreciate you bringing sort of both
[41:50] sides, the tool sides and the workflow
[41:52] sides as well as the culture side to to
[41:54] this conversation.
[41:56] Yeah, definitely. I think the the one
[41:58] word I would use is um to echo what
[42:00] you're saying is alignment. The goal
[42:01] here is not to say something is easy.
[42:04] It's more so to are we all aligned and
[42:06] can we move fast? Um which I think is a
[42:09] is the next superpower as all these
[42:11] tools come out and what could be
[42:13] possible right and uh to you know all
[42:17] the big unicorns today that are coming
[42:19] out or small teams that are moving
[42:21] extremely fast and I think we're all
[42:23] seeing living proof of that with
[42:24] everything that's going on. So yes,
[42:28] nothing to displace good old production
[42:30] resilient code and processes, but this
[42:33] is all before that.
[42:34] Well, and I'll also say I mean annoying
[42:36] PMs have been doing this from the
[42:38] beginning of time, which is I have been
[42:41] I have been guilty of being told no and
[42:43] saying like I set up a an an Excel
[42:46] script that like kind of did the thing
[42:48] that I want or I set up like a zap that
[42:51] is basically the flow I want. Can we and
[42:53] at least now you get code. I mean, you
[42:55] know, you get code and something to
[42:56] click. So, you know, we will forever
[42:58] perpetually as product managers find
[43:00] very annoying ways to ask engineering to
[43:03] build two complicated things and scope
[43:05] creep. It will just happen till the end
[43:07] of time and now we just have more tools.
[43:10] Okay, so let's let's stay on this topic.
[43:12] Let's get to lightning questions. We've
[43:13] been here a while. You know, zooming
[43:16] zooming way out. I think the big
[43:18] takeaway from for me from this
[43:19] conversation is roles are changing and
[43:22] the way companies work is changing. So
[43:25] I'm just curious sort of what are your
[43:26] meta you know predictions on not how is
[43:29] this going to change for an individual
[43:30] product manager but really how are
[43:32] companies going to start to operate
[43:33] differently when they have access to
[43:35] these tools?
[43:36] I mean I think companies are going to
[43:39] figure out a process that helps them
[43:41] validate things faster and move faster
[43:44] very much early on. I think whatever
[43:46] used to be the bottleneck of let's take
[43:48] time let's wait for something to come
[43:50] back let's wait for more analysis to be
[43:52] done is going to shrink which I think in
[43:55] in turn is really good because you don't
[43:57] want confusion after you ship a product
[44:00] which is what causes the most issues
[44:02] right a good PM is now stuck managing
[44:05] disconnects rather than what should have
[44:07] gone out to be successful after spending
[44:09] all the time so I think companies are
[44:12] going to evolve to where they're
[44:13] spending more time with these tools up
[44:15] front and then being very sure of what
[44:18] they want as they move into building um
[44:21] alignment is going to be faster. I think
[44:23] these prototypes from a perspective of
[44:26] aligning all the different departments.
[44:29] I think about also customer support,
[44:30] right? Enterprise applications. You want
[44:32] to be able to support your customers.
[44:33] You have a customer support team. Rather
[44:35] than them reading booklets of
[44:36] information and preparing manual guides,
[44:39] they can now have a prototype. You could
[44:41] explain it to them with that. They are
[44:43] then training like other hundreds of
[44:44] team members like, "Oh, this is how we
[44:46] would support if something happens."
[44:48] This is like super valuable for large
[44:50] organizations. They don't have to wait
[44:52] until a product is done to be able to
[44:54] train. Now they can train on the fly and
[44:57] you're no longer using obsolete
[44:58] technology, right? You're always staying
[44:59] cutting edge, which could be a big
[45:01] differentiator for a lot of large
[45:03] companies, too. So, I think that's
[45:05] that's where I see companies evolving
[45:07] alignment fast and then being able to
[45:09] ship uh with a ship with I would say
[45:12] precision after that.
[45:14] Okay. I I love it. It's like I'm smiling
[45:16] ear to ear. Let's move faster. Let's
[45:18] build better things. Let's enable, you
[45:20] know, our peers in the company a little
[45:22] earlier, um, have them more prepared and
[45:25] give our customers a better experience.
[45:26] Okay. And then you've shown us nothing
[45:28] but perfect outputs. So, I've seen a
[45:31] perfect lovable prototype. I've seen a
[45:33] perfect complexity analysis, gamma
[45:36] presentation, a chef's kiss, uh, chat PR
[45:39] analysis. I've seen all these beautiful
[45:41] things.
[45:42] Please tell me AI sometimes steers you
[45:44] wrong. And so what do you do when AI is
[45:49] not giving you giving you what you want?
[45:51] I think one take a break. Um sometimes
[45:53] it's like you just need to take a break
[45:55] and stop, you know, prompting until the
[45:57] end of credits. Um so yeah, I could be
[46:01] wrong. I mean for you know the one demo
[46:03] that I showed, I have at least three
[46:04] demos that did not work um in terms of
[46:07] building when we're building something
[46:08] to perfection. That's where initially I
[46:11] was doing all of this inside vzero or
[46:13] lovable and then I realized okay I'm
[46:15] spending way too much time iterating
[46:17] inside the tool which should not be. So
[46:18] I think naturally found chat GPD to be
[46:21] the first starting point. So when AI
[46:23] doesn't work you'll take a step back and
[46:25] use something else more broader to be
[46:27] patient because um AI can make mistakes.
[46:30] It's still a developing field but the
[46:32] benefits you know far outweigh um the
[46:35] failures.
[46:36] Yeah. And we were we were joking a
[46:37] little bit before the show saying that
[46:39] how people answer that question is often
[46:41] a reflection of their parenting
[46:42] strategy. And so I like the idea.
[46:44] Honestly, I need to hear this. Sometimes
[46:46] when you're like kid is not doing what
[46:48] you want, like just walk away is usually
[46:50] is usually the answer. You're probably
[46:53] not going to win the argument with the
[46:54] the 5-year-old. Uh so sometimes you just
[46:57] got to go, we're gonna we're gonna take
[46:58] a little break. And so I'm I'm going to
[47:00] take that into my into my AI strategies
[47:02] as well. Well, this has been such a
[47:04] great episode. I've just really enjoyed
[47:06] the conversation top to bottom. Where
[47:08] can we find you and how can we be
[47:09] helpful?
[47:10] Yeah, I'm on LinkedIn um Twitter as well
[47:12] um or X I'm on both platforms. Um
[47:15] LinkedIn is the best place to reach. Um
[47:17] I'll leave my email um here and uh happy
[47:20] to also talk you know um if anybody
[47:22] needs insights on how to advocate for
[47:24] more AI in your product or technology
[47:26] workflows, happy to always support with
[47:28] that. Um but you know I think u we as a
[47:31] community uh need to step together to do
[47:33] this. um and not not overselling your
[47:36] tool, but like the chat purity community
[47:38] or Lenny's community is where I've had
[47:40] very meaningful discussions. You know,
[47:42] I've had a lot of PMs talk about what
[47:44] could be done different and I think uh
[47:47] yeah, that's where you can find me.
[47:49] Yeah. Okay. So, find you on LinkedIn and
[47:52] let's all chat about how we managed this
[47:54] transition together. Well, thank you so
[47:56] much. I really appreciate this PMs. This
[47:57] is one that I hope you've listened to
[47:59] the very end. Thank you so much. I'll
[48:01] see you later.
[48:02] Thank you.
