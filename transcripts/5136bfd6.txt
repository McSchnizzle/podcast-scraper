[00:00] Welcome back to the AI daily brief.
[00:02] Today we are talking about a new
[00:04] initiative from OpenAI where they are
[00:06] launching jobs and certifications. Now
[00:09] what makes this interesting is that
[00:11] there are a variety of interpretations
[00:13] and ways that people are looking at it
[00:15] out there. Some are seeing it as OpenAI
[00:17] deciding that they want to go compete
[00:19] with LinkedIn. Others think it's a
[00:21] response to growing anxiety around AI
[00:24] related job loss. Then there's the
[00:26] interpretation that people think that
[00:27] OpenAI's valuation is too high and
[00:29] they're just throwing things at the wall
[00:30] and seeing what sticks. We're going to
[00:32] break it down, talk about what they're
[00:33] doing, get into some of those takes, and
[00:35] ultimately try to figure out what this
[00:37] says about where the company is headed.
[00:39] So, first of all, let's talk about the
[00:40] news. It was announced by new CEO for
[00:42] applications, Fiji Simo. It was
[00:44] announced with a blog post called
[00:46] Expanding Economic Opportunity with AI.
[00:48] Fiji writes, "Whenever I talk with
[00:50] people about AI, one of the first
[00:52] questions I get is, 'What is it going to
[00:53] mean for my job, or how will it impact
[00:55] my company?" I tell them, I believe AI
[00:58] will unlock more opportunities for more
[01:00] people than any technology in history.
[01:02] It will help companies operate more
[01:03] efficiently, give anyone the power to
[01:05] turn their ideas into income, and create
[01:07] jobs that don't even exist today. But AI
[01:09] will also be disruptive. Jobs will look
[01:11] different. Companies will have to adapt,
[01:13] and all of us, from shift workers to
[01:15] CEOs, will have to learn how to work in
[01:17] new ways. At OpenAI, we can't eliminate
[01:20] that disruption. But what we can do is
[01:22] help more people become fluent in AI and
[01:24] connect them with companies that need
[01:25] their skills to give more people
[01:27] economic opportunities. So what does
[01:29] that look like in practice? Well, like I
[01:30] said, they announced two initiatives.
[01:32] The first is the OpenAI jobs platform.
[01:35] SEMA writes, "If you're a business
[01:37] looking to hire an AI savvy employee or
[01:40] you just need help with a specific task,
[01:42] finding the right person can be hit or
[01:43] miss. The OpenAI jobs platform will have
[01:45] knowledgeable, experienced candidates at
[01:47] every level and opportunities for anyone
[01:49] looking to put their skills to use. Simo
[01:51] also says that this will not just be
[01:53] prioritized for big companies. She
[01:55] writes it will have a track dedicated to
[01:57] helping local businesses compete and
[01:59] local governments find the AI talent
[02:01] they need to better serve their
[02:02] constituents. Naturally, however, with
[02:04] all these people applying for jobs
[02:06] saying that they are AI savvy, how will
[02:08] companies be able to tell if they're
[02:10] actually AI fluent? Well, enter the
[02:12] second product that was announced, AI
[02:14] certifications.
[02:15] This is sort of the natural extension of
[02:17] the OpenAI Academy, which is their
[02:19] online learning platform. Simo writes,
[02:22] "We're going to expand the academy by
[02:23] offering certifications for different
[02:25] levels of AI fluency from the basics of
[02:27] using AI at work all the way up to AI
[02:29] custom jobs and prompt engineering.
[02:31] We'll obviously use AI to teach AI.
[02:33] Anyone will be able to prepare for the
[02:35] certification in Chad GBT study mode and
[02:37] become certified without leaving the
[02:38] app. and companies will be able to make
[02:40] it part of their own learning and
[02:41] development programs. So that's the
[02:43] announcement and like I said there is a
[02:45] lot of interpretation going on around
[02:47] this. The first line of discussion is
[02:49] this idea that OpenAI is somehow now
[02:52] trying to compete with LinkedIn. CNBC's
[02:55] article about this was called OpenAI is
[02:57] building an AI jobs platform that could
[02:58] challenge Microsoft's LinkedIn. And this
[03:01] article's whole thrust is all about how
[03:03] this is yet another sign of the fraying
[03:05] relationship between these two. This was
[03:07] also a common theme on Twitter. Peter
[03:09] Wilderford writes, "What does Microsoft
[03:11] think about this? The Microsoft OpenAI
[03:13] relationship continues to fray." I tend
[03:16] to think that this narrative is
[03:17] completely oversold and misses the mark
[03:19] here. Basically, to the extent that
[03:21] OpenAI ends up competing with LinkedIn
[03:23] because of this initiative, I think that
[03:25] will be incidental to whatever they were
[03:27] trying to accomplish. First of all, as
[03:29] high density as some jobs boards are, it
[03:32] is not winner take all in the same way
[03:33] that a social network is. If you just
[03:35] look at the landscapes of jobs, they're
[03:36] obviously much more fragmented.
[03:38] Theoretically, if you could get everyone
[03:40] in the same spot, it would be really
[03:42] good for everyone, but in practice,
[03:43] that's just not how it's played out.
[03:45] Secondly, it is very normal at this
[03:47] point for companies that are introducing
[03:49] new types of software and new technology
[03:52] to offer some amount of training on
[03:53] their own tools. Salesforce has an
[03:56] entire academy that has its own
[03:57] certifications. Oracle has versions of
[03:59] this. It's just kind of part of what you
[04:01] do. Now, it is the case that Sam Alman
[04:05] has talked about how he's interested in
[04:06] building a social network and so maybe
[04:08] that's inflaming this narrative and the
[04:10] company did bring in an entire CEO of
[04:12] applications in Fiji Simo. So, I don't
[04:14] think it's totally off base, but I
[04:16] mostly think that the people who are
[04:17] talking about this are trying to read it
[04:19] into a Shakespearean drama between
[04:20] Microsoft and OpenAI because it makes
[04:22] for interesting reading. Now, on the
[04:25] other hand, the idea that this is a
[04:27] response to growing job anxiety, I
[04:29] think, is a little bit more legit.
[04:31] Obviously, since they launched, AI
[04:33] companies have been very attuned to this
[04:35] particular concern. The farther away
[04:37] we've moved from people's primary
[04:38] considerations being robot takeovers,
[04:40] the more that jobs really continues to
[04:42] rear its head as the thing that people
[04:44] are anxious about when it comes to AI.
[04:46] And what's more, it definitely feels
[04:48] like that concern is on an upswing right
[04:50] now as we're starting to see studies
[04:52] that show at least some evidence that
[04:55] there may be an impact in certain
[04:56] places. We talked a little bit about
[04:59] this study from Stanford where they
[05:01] argue that there are some indicators
[05:02] that young people in jobs that are more
[05:04] exposed to AI are seeing lower
[05:06] employment rates than their peers. They
[05:08] basically found that early career
[05:10] workers between ages 22 and 25 who were
[05:12] in what they considered the most AI
[05:14] exposed occupations. Basically, they
[05:16] organized all jobs into five categories
[05:18] of how exposed to AI they were. They
[05:21] said those young people in the most AI
[05:23] exposed occupations have seen a 13%
[05:26] relative decline in employment. Now,
[05:28] they're very careful to point out that
[05:29] it is not 100% that that is about AI.
[05:32] There are a lot of other things going
[05:34] on. There's some amount of resetting
[05:36] after a big hiring postco and there are
[05:38] certainly other potential explanations
[05:40] as well, but it's enough of a signal
[05:42] that people are sitting up and paying
[05:43] attention. What's more, a second paper
[05:45] from Harvard PhD students found similar
[05:47] results by analyzing LinkedIn rum√©s and
[05:50] job posting data. The paper was called
[05:52] generative AI as seniority biased
[05:54] technological change evidence from US
[05:56] resume and job posting data and again
[05:58] find some nent but compelling evidence
[06:00] that early career folks are having a
[06:02] harder time in this era of AI. Then on
[06:04] top of all of this, we also this week
[06:06] saw the release of a huge report from
[06:08] the Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity
[06:10] breaking down how many net jobs are
[06:12] expected to be lost sector by sector. It
[06:14] scored each industry on how fast they
[06:16] would be disrupted and came to the
[06:18] conclusion that a net of 45 million US
[06:20] jobs are expected to be lost due to AI.
[06:23] Now this was ultimately a very long
[06:25] pitch for UBI, which is one of the big
[06:26] things that this fund focuses on. So you
[06:28] have to take it with that grain of salt.
[06:30] But our point for the purposes of
[06:32] understanding why OpenAI would do this
[06:33] now is that this narrative is on the
[06:36] rise. Of course though, AI won't just
[06:38] take jobs, it will create new jobs. And
[06:40] that's sort of the point that OpenAI is
[06:41] trying to make with their jobs board.
[06:43] Recently, LinkedIn founder Reed Hoffman
[06:45] was discussing these studies and wrote,
[06:47] "If you're entering the workforce today,
[06:49] you have a unique advantage. You can
[06:51] grow up working with co-pilots,
[06:52] understanding the leverage they give you
[06:53] as an employee, and help your companies
[06:55] figure out how to integrate AI into
[06:57] their work. The real test will be
[06:59] whether we treat this moment as a
[07:00] warning or an opening. I do think that
[07:02] to some extent this is OpenAI trying to
[07:04] get out ahead of that discussion. Now
[07:07] connected to all of this is a political
[07:08] dimension. Open AAI is explicit that
[07:11] this is part of a response to the White
[07:13] House's efforts to expand AI literacy.
[07:15] In that announcement post, Simo wrote,
[07:17] "We're launching these new initiatives
[07:19] as part of our commitment to the White
[07:20] House's efforts towards expanding AI
[07:22] literacy." They also put a number goal
[07:24] around the certification, saying that
[07:25] they're committed to certifying 10
[07:27] million Americans by 2030. Now, outside
[07:29] of whether this was competition for
[07:31] LinkedIn or just a straight response to
[07:32] AI job anxiety, I saw really two
[07:35] different types of interpretations. The
[07:37] first was basically some version of,
[07:39] "Wow, is this company ambitious and
[07:41] they're coming for everything?" And the
[07:43] other was, "This feels like kind of a
[07:44] lack of focus and we're not sure how it
[07:46] all fits together." Nlesh Trevetti, for
[07:48] example, wrote, "Feels like a big anti-
[07:50] signal." To be honest, I actually saw
[07:52] enough variations of these that I
[07:53] tweeted out a little poll asking whether
[07:55] people thought it was a sign of ambition
[07:57] or a sign of being lost in the sauce.
[07:59] And while the sample size is very small,
[08:01] a little under 100 respondents, it was
[08:04] fairly evenly split. 53.6% said it was
[08:07] ambitious, 46.4% said it was an
[08:09] indication of them being lost. Abu from
[08:12] datainsight.com writes, "To me it looks
[08:13] like they're trying everything to be
[08:14] profitable. Right now, their main income
[08:16] is chat GBT and API, but they're clearly
[08:19] moving down the application layer. AI
[08:21] certifications, that could print money.
[08:23] The jobs platform, not so sure. When you
[08:25] scale, chasing every vertical isn't
[08:27] always smart. They're even toying with
[08:29] social media, but honestly, that's
[08:30] unlikely to work. I saw some version of
[08:33] this response a lot. And what I would
[08:35] say about it is that I think it's a
[08:36] little bit more nuanced. First of all,
[08:38] OpenAI's revenue is growing extremely
[08:41] fast. Not as fast as Anthropics right
[08:43] now thanks to the coding applications,
[08:45] but still extremely extremely quickly. I
[08:48] think that they have very barely
[08:49] scratched the surface on just how much
[08:51] consumer and business/ API revenue there
[08:53] is out there. At the same time, OpenAI
[08:56] has always seemed to me to understand
[08:58] that they are going to have to own the
[09:00] relationships with their customers. I do
[09:02] not think that they're content to just
[09:04] build the platform that powers things
[09:05] underneath. I think that they believe
[09:06] that they are going to have to exist at
[09:08] the interface with the customer to have
[09:10] long-term durability and long-term
[09:12] modes. Fiji coming in as the CEO of
[09:15] applications I think is an indicator of
[09:17] that. And there were some people who
[09:19] absolutely groed that this could be a
[09:21] very successful business line. Kevin
[09:23] Yang wrote, "OpenAITs is a great idea.
[09:26] This basically forces people to learn
[09:27] chatgbt to get a job. the best lock in.
[09:30] I would go further and say learning chat
[09:32] GBT is already sort of a requirement to
[09:34] get a job and it's a reasonable thing to
[09:36] explore whether OpenAI wants to be the
[09:37] ones who own the certifications or at
[09:39] least the anchor certifications that
[09:41] says someone is actually good at chatbt.
[09:43] Wes Roth writes, "If the model works, AI
[09:45] fluency could become the next must- have
[09:47] line on every resume and open AI would
[09:49] sit at the center of the talent
[09:50] marketplace it's creating." Again, I
[09:52] think already AI fluency is a must-have
[09:55] line on most resumes. And again, the
[09:57] only question to me is how much it makes
[09:58] sense for the platforms themselves
[10:00] versus third parties to be in the
[10:02] certification game. We moved away from
[10:04] it, but this is something we talked
[10:05] about doing a lot when Super Intelligent
[10:07] was in its earliest incarnations as a
[10:09] learning platform. I think there's the
[10:11] other piece of this which is worth
[10:12] noting that OpenAI might just be legit
[10:14] when they say they really want people to
[10:16] have more economic opportunity in the
[10:17] future. OpenAI's head of education,
[10:19] Leabulski, posted on LinkedIn, "I've
[10:21] spent the last decade of my career
[10:22] building new pathways to jobs and
[10:24] careers in partnerships with
[10:25] universities throughout the world. Open
[10:27] AI has rapidly become a top learning
[10:29] destination and a place where people are
[10:30] demonstrating their skills each and
[10:31] every day. I'm excited to see a world
[10:33] where Open AI can help credential those
[10:35] who have built cutting edge skills and
[10:36] connect them to the jobs of the future.
[10:38] And having known Leah at various parts
[10:40] of her career, which by the way have
[10:41] always been at education companies, I
[10:43] know at least for her, and of course
[10:45] this doesn't necessarily speak for the
[10:46] organization as a whole, those
[10:48] motivations are exactly as she says,
[10:51] ultimately this might just be one of
[10:52] those times where good press meets good
[10:54] business. OpenAI announced this
[10:56] initiative with a bunch of partners,
[10:57] including Walmart, and it strikes me
[10:59] that this is sort of a worst case
[11:01] scenario. This is a good corporate
[11:03] citizen initiative and best case
[11:05] scenario, it's a serious revenue line
[11:06] for the future. In any case, I think a
[11:08] super interesting moment and a super
[11:10] interesting initiative. I'm excited to
[11:11] see how both the jobs board and the
[11:13] certifications roll out. For now though,
[11:15] that is going to do it for today's AI
[11:16] daily brief. Appreciate you listening or
[11:18] watching as always and until next time,
[11:20] peace.
