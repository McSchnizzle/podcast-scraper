[00:00] Welcome back to the AI Daily Brief
[00:01] headlines edition. All the daily AI news
[00:03] you need in around 5 minutes. We kick
[00:06] off today with a story that depending on
[00:08] your perspective is either a sad
[00:10] reflection on how far Apple has fallen,
[00:13] a positive reflection on how much
[00:15] Google's Gemini has started to assert
[00:17] leadership in the AI race, or just an
[00:19] OMG, thank you. My goodness, how long
[00:21] can Siri be bad for before we bring this
[00:23] thing out behind the shed? Yes, it
[00:25] appears that Apple is going to solve its
[00:27] Siri problem by turning to Google.
[00:29] According to Bloomberg's Apple insider
[00:31] Mark German, Apple recently approached
[00:33] Google to quote explore building a
[00:34] custom AI model that would serve as the
[00:36] foundation of the new Siri next year.
[00:38] His sources said that Google had already
[00:40] started training a model that could run
[00:41] on Apple's servers. They added that
[00:43] Apple is still weeks away from making a
[00:45] final decision on whether to partner on
[00:47] the Siri model or continue to use their
[00:49] own internal models. Still, for months,
[00:51] we've heard rumors that the AI Siri
[00:53] project is seen as a dead end and that
[00:55] Apple have been looking around for
[00:56] partners. This, however, is the first
[00:58] time we've heard that they're close to
[00:59] making a final decision. According to
[01:01] the reporting, Apple is in the middle of
[01:03] a bake off with an internally developed
[01:04] Siri going against another that uses
[01:06] outside technology. And while it may
[01:08] seem initially strange for Apple to
[01:10] outsource the defining technology of the
[01:12] moment to a key rival, they do have a
[01:14] long history of being pragmatic and
[01:16] seeding ground to Google when it makes
[01:18] financial sense. Google, for example,
[01:20] famously pays Apple around 20 billion
[01:22] annually to have Google Search as the
[01:24] default setting on iPhones. Given that,
[01:26] if a deal does come together, it'll be
[01:28] interesting to see which way the money
[01:29] flows. The economics of search are
[01:31] clear, but it's still pretty early to
[01:33] know exactly how the money works when it
[01:35] comes to AI powered search. Still, even
[01:38] if AI chatbots have not shown yet the
[01:40] same ad revenue as traditional search,
[01:42] it is obviously a massive data stream
[01:44] that Google could benefit from. Also,
[01:46] whatever happens, it's not going to be
[01:47] like Google just pulls their existing
[01:49] Gemini model off the shelf. Whichever
[01:51] model Apple ends up going with, they
[01:52] want it to run on their own servers.
[01:54] That means it's going to need to be
[01:55] compatible with Apple silicone rather
[01:57] than being optimized for Nvidia chips or
[01:59] Google or presumably Google's TPUs. It's
[02:02] also an open question whether the
[02:03] architecture of iOS itself is a
[02:04] roadblock. Google recently demonstrated
[02:07] most of the functions that had been
[02:08] originally slated for Apple intelligence
[02:10] running on their Pixel 10 handset. At
[02:12] the same time, Android is far more open
[02:13] to cross application interactions than
[02:15] iOS, which could prove a limitation for
[02:17] an agentic Siri. The responses are
[02:20] pretty much what you might imagine. Zero
[02:22] Hedge writes, "Apple has completely
[02:24] given up on AI." Now, former Quant
[02:26] investor Jeffrey Emanuel did note that
[02:28] quote, "Google is probably offering to
[02:30] pay them a lot of money to do this, just
[02:32] like they do to make Google the default
[02:33] search on iPhone and Safari." It's still
[02:35] crazy, though, that Apple would advocate
[02:37] a leadership role of any kind in the
[02:39] most disruptive technology of the last
[02:40] 40 years. Delphi Ventures partner Tom
[02:42] Shaughnessy wrote, "If Apple chooses
[02:44] Google's Gemini to run Siri, it's game
[02:46] over. Gemini would be running AI on all
[02:48] Android and Apple devices around the
[02:50] world. Billions of devices rhfing the
[02:52] models, providing data, and improving
[02:54] the models make the moat even stronger.
[02:56] Would be impossible for a competitor to
[02:58] keep up. Apple could be using this to
[02:59] get better deal terms from OpenAI, who
[03:01] they already have a deal with, though. I
[03:03] also think it would get touchy on
[03:04] antitrust. I think that last point is a
[03:06] salient one where there's no guarantee
[03:08] that this would get through given how
[03:10] much scrutiny Apple's search deal with
[03:11] Google has had in the last couple of
[03:13] years as well. One very expansive
[03:15] analysis came from Robert Scoble. He
[03:17] writes, "It makes sense for Apple to do
[03:19] a deal with Google. This would be good
[03:21] for Hollow fans. Google's Genie 3 is
[03:23] something I want on the Vision Pro in
[03:24] the worst way. It would be good for
[03:26] Google fans who will see its AI and
[03:27] ecosystem strengthened by such a move.
[03:29] It'll be bad for Nvidia and Open AAI. I
[03:32] keep dreaming about Tim Cook doing a
[03:33] deal with Elon Musk, but Google is the
[03:35] best other choice. It has the best real
[03:37] world data, a very decent AI model, and
[03:39] the best hollow deck we've seen so far.
[03:41] And with Whimo has a credible autonomous
[03:42] car network to compete with Elon with,
[03:44] and this is where Scobble's analysis
[03:46] gets even more expansive. This move, he
[03:48] says, strengthens Whimo against Tesla's
[03:50] robo taxi. Apple hates Google
[03:52] culturally, but hates Mark Zuckerberg
[03:54] more. Back a decade or so ago, someone
[03:56] at Apple PR told me that Zuckerberg got
[03:57] in a yelling match with Steve Jobs. And
[03:59] Apple hates Meta's privacy stance.
[04:01] Google isn't the best at privacy, but at
[04:03] least it's a known entity and hasn't
[04:04] done anything nasty on the privacy front
[04:06] and has put the best security
[04:07] protections into Gmail and its other
[04:08] services that I've seen. Google makes
[04:10] its own GPUs and AI inferencing chips
[04:12] for its data centers, which gives it a
[04:14] lot of benefits. And its advertising
[04:15] network is top rate, in many ways,
[04:16] better than Metas. And in the future,
[04:18] advertising will play a big role in
[04:20] funding hollow deck experiences. Apple
[04:22] knows consumers aren't ready for AI
[04:24] glasses yet, but is planning on its own
[04:25] sometime between now and the end of
[04:26] 2027, and its vision pro sets the stage
[04:28] for the future very well. Apple also
[04:30] knows that Sam Alman is gassing up to go
[04:32] into consumer devices over the next
[04:34] decade. So, doesn't want a new hot
[04:36] competitor to take its lunch in robotics
[04:37] or brain computer interfaces either. If
[04:39] Apple makes this deal happen, we'll see
[04:41] a duopoly form like Microsoft and Intel
[04:43] had for decades. It will be hard to
[04:45] disrupt by Zuckerberg or Alman. Now,
[04:47] Scoville, for those of you who don't
[04:48] follow, is much more interested in the
[04:50] hardware, VR, AR kind of world than
[04:53] currently the average consumer is. But I
[04:55] think the patternicity here of how he
[04:56] sees these big tech relationships
[04:58] changing is pretty interesting. Now,
[05:00] staying on Google for just a moment, the
[05:02] company is rolling out AI mode worldwide
[05:04] and taking their first tentative steps
[05:06] towards agentic search. AI mode, which
[05:08] allows users to perform complex queries
[05:10] and ask follow-up questions within
[05:11] search, will now be available across 180
[05:14] countries. The first agentic feature
[05:16] will be the ability to use AI mode to
[05:18] make restaurant reservations based on
[05:20] user preferences. Google says they will
[05:22] soon roll out the ability to make local
[05:23] service appointments and book event
[05:24] tickets as well. The agentic features
[05:27] are only available within the
[05:28] experimental Google labs and will
[05:30] require the $250 a month ultra plan. So
[05:33] this is a very very limited rollout. In
[05:35] fact, given that they are only available
[05:36] in that high price tier, it seems pretty
[05:38] clear that they want to test the
[05:40] features with a very friendly and highly
[05:41] infranchised audience to begin. Now,
[05:44] some are, I think, quite limitedly
[05:46] dismissing this as a one-trick agent.
[05:48] And yet, quite obviously, this is just
[05:49] the beginning of a much grander vision.
[05:51] Google Deepmind research scientist Anal
[05:53] Guli writes, "We just launched Project
[05:55] Mariner in Google search AI mode. One of
[05:57] the most fun projects we've worked on
[05:59] lately behind every search query and
[06:00] agentic system works quietly for you.
[06:02] Maybe one of the most profound
[06:03] interfaces ever built." What's
[06:06] interesting about this, especially given
[06:07] our previous conversation about Apple
[06:08] and Google, is that it kind of seems
[06:10] like Google is making all the moves to
[06:12] integrate AI into people's normal lives
[06:14] in really subtle, simple ways without
[06:15] smashing it over their heads that it's
[06:17] AI that Apple intelligence was supposed
[06:19] to be. Some definitely see this as a
[06:22] trajectory play. Anchor Roy writes,
[06:24] "Project Mariner integration is the real
[06:26] story here. Search becoming an agent
[06:27] that acts versus just retrieves changes
[06:29] the game completely. Reservation booking
[06:31] feels like the obvious first step." Now,
[06:34] staying on the theme of big tech and
[06:36] their battles, Elon Musk continues to be
[06:39] lawsuit happy, suing Apple and Open AAI
[06:41] on Monday for anti-competitive
[06:43] practices. Now, if you've spent any time
[06:45] on Twitter/X lately, you will know
[06:47] exactly what this is about. The
[06:49] information explains that the suit
[06:50] accuses Apple and OpenAI of working
[06:52] together to basically direct people
[06:54] towards Chat GBT and away from
[06:56] competitors like Grock. The information
[06:58] writes XAI's lawsuit also claims that
[07:00] Apple has given ChacheBT favorable
[07:02] placement in its app store and quote
[07:04] dragged out its app store app review
[07:06] process for competitors like Grock wrote
[07:08] the lawsuit. This is a tale of two
[07:09] monopouists joining forces to ensure
[07:11] their continued dominance in a world
[07:12] rapidly driven by the most powerful
[07:14] technology humanity has ever created.
[07:16] And although everything that Elon does
[07:18] is mostly a roar shack test on how you
[07:20] feel about Elon, I would say that this
[07:21] one has even less resonance than normal.
[07:24] Accelerate harder really summed up the
[07:26] feelings of many dennisens of Twitterx
[07:28] when they wrote, "Does anyone really
[07:29] find it plausible that Apple needs to
[07:31] suppress the XAI app for OpenAI to
[07:33] continue beating it on the app store?"
[07:35] "Chatbt is the only AI that most
[07:36] consumers can name and XAI has a porny
[07:39] brand problem in a much smaller install
[07:40] base," responded an OpenAI spokesperson.
[07:43] "The latest filing is consistent with
[07:45] Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of
[07:46] harassment." Now, this not being a soap
[07:49] opera show, we will end it there. Look,
[07:51] at the end of the day, Grock's models
[07:52] are really good and they're moving fast.
[07:54] If you haven't tried out Gro 4 yet, I
[07:56] highly suggest you take some time to do
[07:57] so. I'm still in a phase where I'm
[07:59] running a lot of different strategic
[08:01] prompts by a number of different models,
[08:02] including Gro 4, alongside GPT5, 03,
[08:05] etc. Ultimately, it all just seems like
[08:07] noise, and the real battle is going to
[08:09] be won just by out competing. For now,
[08:11] though, that's going to do it for
[08:12] today's headlines. Next up, the main
