### 🚧 CRITICAL: Phase 2.5 Required Before Phase 3

**RSS Audio Transcription Upgrade** 🎯
- **Current Issue**: OpenAI Whisper works but isn't optimized for podcast content
- **Required Solution**: Switch to NVIDIA Parakeet (NeMo ASR) for production-quality podcast transcription
- **Why Parakeet**: Originally inspired by Tomasz Tunguz's podcast processing system, designed specifically for long-form podcast audio
- **Benefits**: Speaker diarization, podcast-optimized accuracy, GPU acceleration, conversation-aware formatting
- **Impact**: Essential for Phase 3 TTS quality - better transcripts = better audio generation

### ⏳ TODO (Remaining Phases)

**Phase 2.5: RSS Audio Transcription Upgrade** ⚠️ REQUIRED BEFORE PHASE 3
- **Replace Whisper with Parakeet**: Implement NVIDIA NeMo ASR for podcast-optimized transcription
- **Speaker Diarization**: Identify who's speaking when (critical for multi-speaker podcasts)
- **Enhanced Content Analysis**: Leverage better transcripts for improved priority scoring
- **GPU Acceleration**: Faster processing of long-form podcast audio (1-3 hour episodes)
- **Production Quality**: Match the quality used in Tomasz Tunguz's original podcast processing system

**Phase 3: Audio Generation System** 
- **TTS Script Generation**: Optimize content for Eleven Labs TTS synthesis
- **Voice Assignment**: Topic-specific narrator selection (Morgan Freeman-style gravitas)
- **AI Music Generation**: Topic-specific transition music creation
- **Audio Compilation**: Combine narration + music into final episodes (5-10 min segments)
- **Historical Fallback**: Wikipedia integration for slow news days

**Phase 4: Distribution & Automation**
- **RSS Feed Generation**: Podcatcher-compatible RSS feed creation
- **Daily Scheduling**: Automated daily execution before commute time
