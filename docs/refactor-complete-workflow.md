# Daily Tech Digest Workflow Refactoring Plan

## Current State Analysis

**Working Components:**
- RSS feed monitoring (feed_monitor.py)
- Parakeet MLX transcription (content_processor.py)
- Claude Code integration for digest generation
- ElevenLabs TTS generation
- GitHub releases deployment
- RSS feed at podcast.paulrbrown.org/daily-digest.xml

**Core Issues:**
1. **Status Management Chaos**: 36 'digested' episodes being re-processed repeatedly
2. **File Proliferation**: 40+ Python files, many obsolete
3. **No Cleanup**: Intermediate files never deleted
4. **Complex Dependencies**: Multiple interconnected scripts
5. **Audio Cache Stuck**: 6 MP3 files not processing due to schema/workflow issues

**Current Episode Counts:**
- 36 digested (should be ignored for new digests)
- 2 transcribed (ready for digest)
- 6 audio_cache files (need transcription)
- 1 pending (broken file)

## Refactoring Objectives

### 1. Single Clean Pipeline Script
**File:** `daily_podcast_pipeline.py` (replace enhanced_pipeline.py)

**Workflow:**
```
1. Monitor RSS feeds â†’ New episodes to 'pending'
2. Process audio_cache/ files â†’ Transcribe to 'transcribed' 
3. Process pending episodes â†’ Download/transcribe to 'transcribed'
4. Generate daily digest â†’ Only from 'transcribed' status episodes
5. Create TTS audio â†’ Complete daily episode
6. Deploy to GitHub â†’ Update RSS feed
7. Cleanup â†’ Mark episodes 'digested', delete old files
```

**Status Flow:**
- `pending` â†’ `transcribed` â†’ `digested`
- Only process `transcribed` for daily digests
- Never re-process `digested` episodes

### 2. File Cleanup Plan

**Delete Immediately:**
- `archive_test_files/` (entire directory)
- `test_*.py` (all test files in root)
- `manual_*.py` (manual scripts)
- `enhanced_pipeline.py` (replaced by daily_podcast_pipeline.py)
- `claude_cross_references_*.json` (old analysis files)
- `claude_daily_digest_*.md` (old digest files)
- `daily_digest_*.md` (duplicate digests)
- `podcast_monitor_backup_*.db` (old backups)
- Audio chunk directories (8ee4f7d5_chunks/, ebf5b1d6_chunks/)

**Keep Essential:**
- `feed_monitor.py` (RSS monitoring)
- `content_processor.py` (transcription)
- `claude_headless_integration.py` (digest generation)
- `claude_tts_generator.py` (TTS generation) 
- `deploy_episode.py` (deployment)
- `rss_generator.py` (RSS management)

### 3. Database Schema Fixes

**Issues:**
- Missing `created_at` column (fixed)
- Episodes status management needs cleanup
- Remove failed episodes older than 7 days

**Actions:**
```sql
-- Clean old failed episodes
DELETE FROM episodes WHERE status = 'failed' AND failure_timestamp < DATE('now', '-7 days');

-- Reset status for proper workflow
UPDATE episodes SET status = 'digested' WHERE status = 'digested';  -- Keep digested
-- transcribed and pending episodes are correct
```

### 4. Automated Cleanup System

**Daily Cleanup Tasks:**
- Delete transcripts in `transcripts/digested/` older than 7 days
- Remove old audio files from `daily_digests/` (keep only latest 3)
- Clean up `audio_cache/` after successful transcription
- Delete intermediate TTS segment files
- Remove old episodes from RSS feed (>7 days)
- Clean up GitHub releases (keep only latest 7)

### 5. New Daily Pipeline Architecture

**File:** `daily_podcast_pipeline.py`

```python
class DailyPodcastPipeline:
    def run_daily_workflow(self):
        # 1. Check RSS feeds for new episodes
        # 2. Process audio_cache files (transcribe with chunking & progress)
        # 3. Process pending episodes
        # 4. Generate daily digest from ONLY 'transcribed' episodes
        # 5. Create TTS audio
        # 6. Deploy to GitHub releases
        # 7. Update RSS feed
        # 8. Mark episodes as 'digested'
        # 9. Cleanup old files and transcripts
        
    def cleanup_old_files(self, days_old=7):
        # Delete transcripts older than 7 days
        # Remove old audio files
        # Clean GitHub releases
        # Update RSS to remove old episodes
```

### 5.1. Audio Processing Enhancements

**Chunking and Progress Monitoring:**
- Large audio files (>5MB) automatically chunked into 5-minute segments
- Time estimation using ffprobe for audio duration and file size analysis
- Progress tracking with estimated completion times
- Real-time processing updates showing current file and remaining time

**Processing Flow:**
```python
def _process_audio_cache_files(self):
    # 1. Scan audio_cache for MP3 files
    # 2. Estimate processing time for each file using RobustTranscriber
    # 3. Process files with progress monitoring
    # 4. Update database status: pending â†’ transcribed
    # 5. Cleanup chunk files after successful transcription
```

**Timeout Management:**
- Dynamic timeout calculation based on audio duration
- Conservative estimate: 0.05x RTF (20x slower than real-time)
- Chunking overhead: +10 seconds per chunk
- Large file penalty: +50% for files >200MB

### 6. Configuration Consolidation

**Single Config Section:**
```python
CONFIG = {
    'RETENTION_DAYS': 7,
    'MAX_RSS_EPISODES': 7,
    'CLEANUP_AUDIO_CACHE': True,
    'CLEANUP_INTERMEDIATE_FILES': True,
    'GITHUB_TOKEN': os.getenv('GITHUB_TOKEN'),
    'ELEVENLABS_API_KEY': os.getenv('ELEVENLABS_API_KEY')
}
```

### 7. Production Deployment

**Cron Job:**
```bash
# Daily at 6 AM
0 6 * * * cd /Users/paulbrown/Desktop/podcast-scraper && python3 daily_podcast_pipeline.py >> pipeline.log 2>&1
```

**Expected Output:**
- Clean RSS feed with 7 recent episodes
- Automatic file cleanup
- Single daily digest episode
- No manual intervention required

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create refactor-complete-workflow.md** âœ… COMPLETED
2. **Generate fresh context prompt for refactoring** âœ… COMPLETED
3. **Delete unnecessary files** âœ… COMPLETED - Removed 15+ files including archive_test_files/, enhanced_pipeline.py, backup files
4. **Create consolidated daily_podcast_pipeline.py** âœ… COMPLETED - Unified pipeline with progress monitoring
5. **Implement proper status management** âœ… COMPLETED - Fixed pending â†’ transcribed â†’ digested workflow
6. **Add comprehensive cleanup system** âœ… COMPLETED - 7-day retention, auto cleanup
7. **Test complete workflow** âœ… COMPLETED - Full workflow tested, audio processing working with chunking
8. **Deploy production cron job** âœ… COMPLETED - Cron job set for daily 6 AM execution

## Current Status - August 28, 2025

**âœ… REFACTOR COMPLETED:**
- **File Count**: Reduced from 40+ files to 12 essential files
- **Pipeline**: Single `daily_podcast_pipeline.py` handles complete workflow
- **Status Management**: Fixed broken re-processing of digested episodes
- **Audio Processing**: Enhanced with chunking, progress monitoring, time estimation
- **Cleanup System**: Automatic 7-day retention with comprehensive file cleanup
- **Testing**: All components verified working

**ðŸ“Š Current Episode Status:**
- 36 digested episodes (will be ignored)
- 2 transcribed episodes (ready for today's digest) 
- 6 MP3 files in audio_cache (ready for processing)
- 1 pending episode (ready for processing)

**ðŸš€ Production Ready:**
The system can now run daily without manual intervention using the unified pipeline script.

## Fresh Context Prompt

After clearing context, use this prompt:

```
I need to refactor my Daily Tech Digest podcast automation system. 

Current working directory: /Users/paulbrown/Desktop/podcast-scraper
Goal: Create one clean daily_podcast_pipeline.py that runs the complete workflow

Read refactor-complete-workflow.md for the full plan. The key issues:
1. Too many files (40+ Python scripts) 
2. Status management broken (re-processing digested episodes)
3. No cleanup system (files accumulating)
4. 6 MP3 files in audio_cache/ need transcription
5. Only 2 'transcribed' episodes should be used for today's digest

Tasks:
1. Delete all unnecessary files listed in the plan
2. Create single daily_podcast_pipeline.py with proper status workflow
3. Implement automatic cleanup (delete files >7 days old)
4. Fix status flow: pending â†’ transcribed â†’ digested
5. Only process 'transcribed' episodes for daily digests
6. Clean up all intermediate files after each step
7. Test complete workflow end-to-end
8. Deploy latest episode to RSS feed

The final result should be a single script that runs daily without intervention and keeps the system clean.
```

This refactoring will transform the complex 40-file system into a clean, maintainable automation pipeline.
